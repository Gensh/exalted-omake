# What about slug-throwers?

Slug-throwers, sometimes called steel-casters, stubbers, or the like depending on place of manufacture, are a rare form of ranged weapon. While typically resembling some form of flamepiece, larger models may more closely resemble projected essence weapons. Savants who have sought great weapons across voids of unreality or the dreams of the Wyld are often consumed by disappointment in finding only this failed experiment, time and time again. Why are slug-throwers so prevalent in other Shards?

In spite of complex designs seen in other shinmaic configurations, slug-throwers are conceptually simple. Firedust is ignited within a chamber so that its explosion is compressed and expels a projectile at incredible velocity. While this sounds _interesting_ for a purely physical weapon, it simply isn't useful. They are never as accurate as traditional ranged weapons, have even poorer compatibility with supernatural wielders than essence weaponry, and are prone to blowing off mortal wielders' fingers.

Only in Autochthonia, with its culture of technological innovation by and for mortals, ever developed the technology to a state which could be considered "usable". It was still vastly cheaper and more reliable to deploy crossbows in the same circumstances.

## Historical Experiments

During the High First Age, a handful of tinkerers, artists, and bored weapons dilettantes attempted to improve on existing designs. These experiments produced most of the designs which survive to modern times. However, both schematics and working models are terribly rare, as the Bronze Faction feared strengthening mortals too much would weaken the fledgling Shogunate.

A few artifacts, too precious to destroy, have survived in Solar tombs or the private collections of Sidereals or the most ancient Dragonblooded families. These include works such as prayer pieces, which are miniature shrines to the Unconquered Sun that can only fire slugs inscribed with benedictions.

It has also been rumored that the Underworld continues with its own designs. Ghosts are many and have little to fear from self-destructing weapons. The First and Forsaken Lion is said to equip his mortal auxiliaries with particularly volatile slug-throwers, cursed so that wielders slain by their own weapon find they yet still hold it with spectral hands.

## Hellish Innovation

Once the Seal of Eight Divinities was broken, and the Yozis learned of secret paths to reach their sleeping brother, raids brought a great deal of mortal technology to the Demon City. Much of this was not useful to the Unquestionables or the Chosen and so was given to the serfs for their amusement.

Demons, especially the least breeds, have always been cruelly clever, and regard for a serf's life is low to start. Unlike humans, they did not hesitate to use these dangerous new tools. What was risk of death to one's own weapon against all the other thousand deaths to come? A number of figures emerged from this era, serfs or newly-minted citizens who were stubsmiths of great renown.

All those demons are dead now. Lucien was terribly busy for six weeks.

All it took was for one serf to strive too high. They realized the incredibly assassination potential of a self-powered weapon and built what is thought of as the first long-stubber. Of course, using this new weapon to assassinate a citizen was an unforgivable act of a lesser being attacking their better and so stirred sleeping Sacheverell. The Lawmaker Princess forbid slug-throwers to all but the Unquestionable, and the Guardian of Sleep purged millions.

## The Wolf Queen of Chiaroscuro

The Chosen of Hell were frustrated at the new laws, not because the weapons were useful, but because the Yozis had never so uniformly denied them before. This was during the time of the first generation, and so their response was disorderly. Rather than present their case before the gathered Demon Princes and their Queen-Mother, the most furious Green Sun Princes simply forged horrifying artifact slug-throwers and went on rampages through the demon streets.

Few endured Malfeas' retribution with all their limbs still attached. This left Nebata Higarda, former head of the Nebata Family of Chiaroscuro, to collect a dozen artifacts and thousands of mundane slug-throwers before the Silent Wind swept the rest into the depths of the Demon Sea.

Higarda had decades of experience in tight-quarters urban combat where bows were too slow and firewands could spell disaster. She'd just watched the greatest such combat, as demons fought for their lives through the alleys and corridors of the Demon City. The serfs never had a chance, but with time, they learned to slow down even the implacable Guardian of Sleep. Those same tactics, used by mortals against anything short of a Magistrate? Unbeatable.

As for Higarda herself, she scraped an identical pair of soulsteel-casters from the smoldering remains of a March caste and has been using them ever since. Since she's capable of running faster than they fire, her combat flourishes often involve trapping her foes behind walls of speeding projectiles.

## The Champion of Hypocrisy

Not long later, Cecelyne succeeded for the first and only time in her long line of attempts at stealing the Great Maker's sodalts. Though manufacturing is not part of a Luminor's purview, Higarda pressed the junior Chosen into further developing slug-thrower technology. After all, doing so would help his beloved Nation, wouldn't it? And that would ease the pain of betraying the Great Maker for his ancient enemies, no?

This would lead to a catastrophic war within the Realm of Brass and Shadow, but we will not speak of that here. The end result for Creation is that modern slug-throwers are at last safe and easily the most effective ranged weapon for mortal hands, just as they are in other Shards, onlyâ€¦ no one get hold of them. A very small number of art pieces are sold by the Nebata Family to colectors, but they can otherwise only be found in hands approved by Cecelyne's priesthood.

Naturally, this means that most are held by the militia and special policing forces in the Hierophant's city-state of Tzent. Thieves have tried to escape with slug-throwers before, but the surveillance of that land is so complete that even the stealthy among the Exalted would be strained to the limits of their abilities.
