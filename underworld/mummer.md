# The Many-Eyed Mummer of Ages

There are two groups called "Deathlords." The original thirteen were the vengeful ghosts of Solars slain by their servants, horrid spirits who abandoned their humanity and were melded with the scraps of slain devas. However, these original Deathlords were very secretive during the Shogunate and none too noisy even after its fall. It was well known that "Deathlords" were behind the Contagion and then the Crusade, but what even _was_ a Deathlord?

The appearance of the thirteen marked the first time it was possible for such beings to exist. Prior to that point, forces of the Solar Deliberative and very bored Lunars would intermittently strike at gathering powers in the Underworld which did not properly submit. The Shogunate could scarcely afford such a burden, and so many ghostly powers saw and era of ascent. Later, when the concept of Deathlords became known, many tyrants among the dead seized the prestige of the title.

Some were allowed to do so. Some were simply too small to be worth the effort of stamping out. Some were in inconvenient locations. By the time the Bishop of the Chaceldony Thurible objected loudly enough for the other twelve to care, there were already too many to be rid of. The dead possess infinite time, but even they weary of tedium. The sins of the living were a more pressing and more interesting concern. Pale imitators could be stamped out later.

## The Black Gate's Prism-Bleeding Key

For all the original Deathlords' pomp, they did not realize they had been infiltrated. It is not clear if all the original thirteen were indeed Solars and one was destroyed in secret or if they were deceived from the beginning. Yet it came to pass that the Deathlord known as Black Gate's Prism-Bleeding Key revealed himself a former Sidereal Exalt.

Bleeding Key's plan to doom Creation was accordingly lesser in scope and vastly more complex. He would simply buy the world. He would fund the industries of war and revolution until the Exalted were driven to fight with sticks and stones. Who could defeat an undead Sidereal master in unarmed combat?

This future would for certain come to pass. All he needed was for the Ebon Dragon's plan to go slightly wrong, for great heroes to become embroiled in the Yozis' ill-conceived plans of escape. They would slay sleeping Sacheverell by mistake and create the whispers which called to him from the future, the eventual Neverborn called Dark Fates Foretold who sees only the ways by which Creation might be destroyed.

Those heroes foiled this plan, however. They acted out of order, not as their Dark Fates had been set. They freed the fetich soul of the Ebon Dragon, who revealed much of the world which had been lost. Bleeding Key sought to forcibly guide them back to the path lost, but the Walker in Darkness intervened, and the opportunity was lost. Bleeding Key's identity was revealed, and now he was pariah among his peers. Others were fools and failures, but he was not one of them. He had never held their glory.

## The Gathering of the Deathlords

The reveal of the Sidereal Deathlord broke the unity of the original thirteen. Their masters may have been able to drive them together once more, but doing so would show them more concern than their masters cared to give. Instead, the useful among the false Deathlords were given chance to show their worth. The promising would be given lesser scraps of deva-corpus.

The now-twelve true, Solar Deathlords, gathered the others to them according to their own predilections. Certainly, additional Solar ghosts from various eras joined their ranks, but the shame of not being "Solar" was lesser among the mixed ranks of lesser deathlords.

Indeed, after centuries of bickering with their peers, several among the original Deathlords came to appreciate these lesser lords all the more. The younger ghosts offered new perspectives and could never challenge the power of an original. Though the paranoia of a ghost forged by betrayal could never be deeply assuaged, it could weaken enough for some semblance of ordinary court behavior.

## Enter the Mummer

The only Sidereal lesser-deathlord is the newly-reforged Many-Eyed Mummer of Ages. He held no real standing in the Underworld prior to his death but owed an unspecified favor to the terrible hekatonchire Icon Upon Nirvana's Orpheum. At the moment of his death, his hun soul was torn apart and infused with scraps of her self, turning him to a shuddering ghoul with eyes of azure snow. The Neverborn do not speak of the Icon, and her plans remain unknown. What _is_ known is that she has procured a single Deathknight for her new minion, a Moonshadow caste named Gatecrasher in Silent Prayer.

The original Deathlords hold the Mummer in divided opinion. They hate him for his role in their own deaths but take delight in how he too was betrayed and slain by an apprentice. Their fear or caution of the ancient Icon casts this with an overriding wariness. Most simply leave the Mummer to his own devices, which suits his purposes well.

Personally, he is not impressed. He slew more in defense of Creation than most of them ever did as creatures of the Void.

## Of Visions Dark and Empty

By the power of Dark Fates Foretold, the Black Gate's Prism-Bleeding Key had read the future in a manner similar to a living Sidereal. The Neverborn-self of Sacheverell allowed the Deathlord to glimpse parts of Samsara, the underlying script of the world.

The Mummer operates in reverse, using the principle of Nirvana, the gaps in that script. Looking upon Nirvana is to see the darkness in the Primordials' vision for Creation which might be illuminated by moments of greatness. There can be no predicting which may occur, but this freedom from scripts means that an observer can coax more desired persons and events into those moments of greatness.

As a former Sidereal elder, the Mummer is a master of narrative calculus which spans ages. It would be a trivial matter to plan for a Deathknight to crash through several such moments, erupting in a final, Creation-shaking action.

## A Future for the Dead

It is the fundamental philosophy of the Mummer that the only freedom from duty is Oblivion. Should a mortal die and reincarnate as a privileged Dynast, they have only traded one burden for another. All which has been gained is a greater ability to drown one's cares in vice and the vice called glory. Power is not freedom from duty but duty in different forms. Duty is all-consuming and all-grinding. Existence itself is shackled with duties.

The spectres and nephwracks and things of the void hear this and bleakly rejoice, for they too are hollow and tired. The dead divinity IUNO laughs as she always has. They misunderstand her puppet. He will continue to entertain her in his fruitless service to Creation, until his struggles cease to amuse. The Mummer sees this as a challenge. He will not fail again.

The Mummer does not focus on any one area of Creation. As in life, he spends most of his time politicking in the courts of the mighty, sometimes visiting the courts of the Solar Deathlords but preferring to remain in his deathlord's palace at Stygia's heart. He maintains cordial relations with the Dual Monarchy and all thirteen Councilors as a brutally neutral arbiter of affairs.

Most times, however, he can be found in his office, plotting increasingly-elaborate sequences of events which may never occur. Most of these are far beyond the scope of his single Deathknight, but it is rumored that he commands other forces in Creation. Servants of the greater Deathlords sometimes pay him special attention as a result, and some of those Deathlords have sent a former colleague of his to press for information.
