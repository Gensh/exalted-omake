# Dead to Rites Outline

## 1

- Cecelyne descends to the Mouth of the Void to claim Bright Shattered Ice's necklace and "contract"
    - Cece bamboozled BSI during the architecting of the demon realm to control the Flaw of Invulnerability
    - Cece is personally interested in helping BSI since she feels they're similar in curiosity and need for control
- Ignored by hekatons due to "above your paygrade" aura
- Constantly kicking sand ahead to connect to main Desert
- "Prayer to Equal" to open the sarcophagus
    - Whose Whispers Chain/Queen of Suicides, fka Hunanura Heartfrost Unending
 
## 2

- Chain assumes Cece is mortal and attacks with suicidal ideation
    - Cece remembers being Zaemon
    - Bottles of pills; defended by imagining how bad it'd hurt and feel socially to fail
    - Knife; defended by imagining the work needed to sharpen, make it quick, etc
- Cece counters by beaming image of her perfect form and glory to make Chain aware
- Chain acknowledged by remembering
    - Cece was ivory and azure above, shadows below
    - Huna was dark clouds above, ivory and azure below
    - Great friends and rumored to be lovers
    - "Darkness dwelled in the shadows of the Law. The gentle clouds of the untroubled sky warded against the equanimous displeasure of the Green Sun."
- Cece reflects on how misguided humans are by thinking the Neverborn "Dead Primordials"
    - Less than a hungry ghost, since those were at least lower souls
    - Neverborn are merely echoes and dying dreams

## 3

- Conflict centers on Huna feeling betrayed
    - Cece "touches everything and eternity, but only with her Law"; she doesn't like personal contact
    - Cece chose to hold the center and continue protecting Yu Shan and form a defensive bulwark out of duty rather than save her friend in the distant North
    - "Maybe I loved you"
    - "I'll mourn the person you are but not cater to the thing which haunts your memory"
- Chain tries to convince Cece to die with her, to make amends
    - Cece might have accepted as a Yozi and made TED/Oramus meet with the Neverborn to avoid giving herself the option
    - She's too full of piss and vinegar to die now

## 4

- Cece and Chain hug out out, even as it burns Cece
    - Making good on past avoidance
    - "I did love you, but I lied to myself. Better to avoid the risk of putting myself out there. Better to not ask whether I loved anyone more than my brother."
- Chain's mausoleum shifts as a massive fetter physically shatters
- Chain communicates that there was another situation like theirs which she has been trying to freeze out
    - Cece frustrated that Chain compares her to Desus
    - Also amused that Chain was a softie and has been trying to help BSI
    - Cece tells Chain that's why she's here
    - Back and forth communication of observing BSI's growing paranoia
- Cece promises to watch over BSI, and Chain hands over the necklace
    - Another fetter gone
- With such a weight shift from the previous two, the lesser fetters break, and Chain begins to enter freefall
- Cece panics and tells Chain to hold on, that they'll find a way to make something from her memories
- Chain refuses and kicks her out, sarcophagus falling in the shape of a great clawed hand letting go
- Cece is still an Empyreal and tries to heave Chain back up
    - It's unclear if she could succeed, but she can't use her true charms
    - "Make a deal with me! I'm sorry I'm still a coward, but I _need_ a social contract!"
- Cece is scalded by Oblivion but fails to stop Chain from falling in
- Flutter of wings and slow clap
- "I'm _not_ in the mood, IUNO."
