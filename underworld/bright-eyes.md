# Bright Eyes

## Introduction

### 1

For all the kindliness he affected, the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible rarely received guests. Imagine his delight when his goodly neighbor wrote to ask if she might visit to consult on matters of the spirit.

A plot, of course. The woman was incorrigible. Yet, she overestimated herself as always. This was an avenue for enlightenment, for communion between fellow apostles of Oblivion when their numbers steadily waned.

And, perhaps, if he were honest with himself, a pleasant diversion with… was she a _friend_, all those years ago? Frequent co-conspirator? No matter, the bonds of life should be as nothing.

Of course, he would have to… insist that she veil herself. Oh, to show his flock the terror of two Deathlords walking in stride would be a marvelous spectacle of inevitability. Yet, if they were to lay eyes upon the one who embodied the beauty of Death, they might develop needless fetters.

He manifested his ever-shifting manse, the Hidden Tabernacle, in its easternmost shadowland as a show of grace. It truly made no difference, but performative gestures grease the wheels of ego – and what else is a ghost?

### 2

The manse squatted in the snowdrifts of the valley for a week like an ugly, gilded gargoyle. Blearying incense smoke poured from holes in the decrepit structure like bile from a mouth with too many corners. The discordant dirge of an outsized organ howled through the weary stone walls and the chips in the ancient gold leaf.

The aboveground structure, in its petite size and unmaintained state, seemed as if an ancient local shrine which had fallen into disfavor but had yet avoided looting. However, that could never be. Its architecture and its very stone were altogether foreign. More, it could never be mistaken for abandoned.

On the first night, the flocks had come. They raised the banners of their faith and made obeisance to the Shining One. They would prove their righteousness and orthodoxy over the heretics all around. They would die righteous and true deaths, and the few who lived would come to pray at His side until their victorious but unneeded flesh fell away.

And so they did. On the eighth day, those condemned to live welcomed yet more to the cause. They raised their prayers to the sky once more and feasted their last before joining battle as their predecessors did.

Those who had fallen yet who did not abandon faith fought alongside their living counterparts, so that they might see the inner chambers of the Tabernacle together. A few days more, and there was no difference between life and death: all was prayer and battle and haggard eyes which glinted with the Shining One's cold light.

It was on the thirteenth day, as the second sectarian purge was reaching its height that a palanquin appeared over the rim of the valley. The lonely guard of the temple's only door blew a sad trumpet which opened the gate early.

The wretched combatants thought perhaps they would receive early reward or due punishment for their failure to slay the heretics swiftly. All knees collapsed in the bloodstained snow, all brows pressed into the cold and iron as the Shining One emerged in a visceral, gilded haze which turned the throat to fluid and caused the mind to wash away.

The palanquin opposite was borne aloft by four who were beautiful but yet lived. They were not Chosen of Death, but of lesser things and so creatures of pity. Their faces bore the look of Death, but there would ever be too much life in their spirits. This instinctive resistance to final peace was the curse of crueler gods.

Who then was this saintly figure, swathed in the deepest miasma of the Void, yet who kept such damned creatures leashed nearby?

The Bishop emerged into the gently-spiraling snow with a smile which could be mistaken for genuine. He was garbed lightly for the weather and for his ostensible position. His pitch-black cassock was clean but worn, and an umber stole marked with eye-watering sacred signs resembled a muffler.

"My dear!" he called out over the shocked zealots with a sweetness that hurt their hearts. "Come! It has been far too long, my child!"

He beckoned, but not to them. It was as if he had no awareness of them. As he strode across the slush thick with their lifeblood, it silently sizzled away so that his every footfall was upon barren earth.

"Let us be away from these dull sights and out of this poor excuse for Oblivion's chill."

As he spoke, the words eviscerated their spirits. They lived for him, sought death for him. So far below his notice, they finally _truly_ felt the Void he preached. A few living realized this and took their own lives before they forgot the feeling. Some of the dead hurled themselves into the bowels of the earth, as if that would lead to the promised land of the Labyrinth.

Slowly, the Bishop made his way to meet the palanquin halfway. The living things bowed – but not so far as the zealots. The Shining One was not their liege. He extended a hand to the edge of the curtain.

The hand that closed on his was flawless. The leg that emerged, concealed in skirt and boot as it was, was flawless. The whole which emerged, indiscernible within voluminous and a hooded veil, still possessed a wicked, tempting magnetism. Every piece of the attire was just _slightly_ imperfect. Just a bit of ankle showed, just a glimpse of cheek. The few who dared raise their heads were instantly smitten.

The Bishop pretended not to notice. Later, of course. He couldn't let her corruption spread, but it would be rude to deal with such a trifle while she was present. He took her hand and guided her down from the palanquin and onto the path he had burned through the snow.

He rankled a little. This was not an attire he had seen before. Certainly, he had requested it, but he was disgusted to find that it possessed power over even _himself_. Not carnally – of course not – but it bore sacred signs much like his own, and he found himself unwittingly fascinated by the cipher.

_She Who Must Be Obeyed_, indeed. He was impressed as much as he was frustrated. A simple trick. But it worked.

"Such a lovely pattern," he said, a little further back in his throat than he'd have liked. "You _must_ tell me how you broke the ghosts to work with such precision. Oh, and it's all so very unique. I'm curious as to the– oh, do forgive an old man."

He continued smiling, his blind eyes staring at the impassive screen of her veil.

"I have had precious few opportunities to discuss such niceties since our brother so shamefully cast himself upon the Sun's mercy."

As convenient as it was to have a rival removed, he almost missed the Walker in Darkness. The rest were… lacking in fervor and theological rigor. This seeming change in the Lover was welcome. However insincere or short-lived, it was a chance to spread the Gospel of Oblivion. If he changed the way she conducted herself in the slightest, it would be a victory worthy of the diversion.

The Lover simply nodded in silence. Her expression could not be seen through the veil. It was some material he didn't immediately recognize. Active charms could certainly peer through, but why be so rude when she was considerate enough to refrain from speaking around his flock?

He wrapped a heavy arm around her shoulder and began to lead her inside. Silence was a blessing, but it was not for him today. As they walked, he made sure to keep speaking, to save her from temptation, of course.

Down they went, through the eye-watering incense fog and into the hopelessly-winding tunnels of soulsteel and black stone. Below the shrine proper and all the trappings of worship, the Bishop's more private chambers were understated and disarming.

The pair entered through the library, where the gentle candlelight and unassuming books promised a reprieve from the maddening dark of the tunnels. Of course, even the lightest of such tomes would send a reader past the edge of madness. Light reading for a Deathlord.

Here, there were no mere ghosts. The library was tended by nephwracks, the twitching, whispering specters so focused on their tasks that they seemed almost mundane.

The Deathlords sat together on chairs made from bones worn so heavily they no longer had shape which could be distinguished from wood. There was a low table between them with a black iron candelabra and candles which burned some stinking, pale wax that provided stable white light for reading.

They were not here to read, of course. But to speak. Perhaps not as friends – but in similar fashion. Going through the motions. Establishing a pattern to keep themselves from devolving to unproductive mutual sabotage. Such was the way of ghosts.

Finally, the Lover removed her veil. The Bishop shuddered. He was long jaded to her raw appearance, but…

"Oh, you look positively dreadful, my dear! If this is moliation, you've discovered something horrid. The blush is almost… lifelike."

She smiled a thin, knowing smile with lips the color of a fresh bruise.

"Yes," she murmured. "Astounding, isn't it?"

The blueness, sparkle, and fathomless depth of her eyes exceeded the Maiden of Serenity's. The Bishop had seen it all before, but there was something suffocating about it now. She was moving no Essence – a new inherent power she was testing? Yet his defensive charms had not stirred.

"I worry for you," the Bishop deflected, quashing his own thoughts as well. "For all of us. Our Lords have been weeping much as of late. That patricidal Tepet woman has caused them much grief, and now some of their first children-in-death have begun to vanish as well."

His blind eyes seemed to look at her appraisingly, giving her opportunity to confess if she had simply… borrowed the Vodak. If she had, she did not wish to speak of it, her face impassive.

"Your request to meet – while unexpected – did this old heart some good. We elect should confer more frequently, to better keep the faith and to confer against our gathering enemies. It seems Creation has finally been stirred from its long lethargy. We must work together, then, to awaken it to the truth of the coming End."

The Lover's eyes narrowed to focus in a way which seemed dreamy and harmless.

"Oh, but Father… It is easy to make such declaration. But how will it resonate with the young Exalted who believe themselves invincible? Might you share, perhaps… the source… of your enlightenment?"

Her smile grew wider as she leaned in. Her head angled slightly. Though her robes still concealed her silhouette, the seduction in every slight movement was unmistakable.

"Not your… personal visitation with the divine. No, of course not. That's… personal. And would not have the same effect on the living. No. No, no. What… broke you… when you were one of them?"

Her eyes burned with a cold light. The Essence of the manse was still and comforting, but the Void within him reflexively flared up, shielding his mind. What power was this?

"Please, Father, won't you share of your vast experience? Guide this lost lamb?"

She pouted, and his will wavered in spite of himself.

"I've been thinking lately," she continued. "Reflecting on those last days. I think I was ready to kill her, you know. You beat me to it. Did you do that on purpose?"

Her eyes darkened. With his mind already turned to thoughts of life, he clearly saw the woman she had been as the Lover let her mask slip.

"How did you die during that whole affair? I'm curious now. You know, I–"

"This is not an appropriate topic of inquiry, child," the Bishop said firmly. "The past is dead. I know not what leeway the beneficent Tears of Want has granted you to indulge such sinful thoughts, but I will not coddle you in the same manner."

"Truly?" she hummed, tilting her head opposite. "Then how will you break the Chosen, guide them to the Shining Path? Empathy is a weapon beyond peer."

"The road of faith is often paved with obstacles. It is only once one's feet and heart are calloused from overcoming such trials that one has the strength to lead others on that road."

He expected resistance, but she leaned back in the chair, eyes blinking in a way that didn't quite entice.

"Yes," she said quietly. "I know that well."

It was uncanny. Was she trying to trip him up?

"You are right. I _have_ sinned."

This was a trap of some sort.

"Father, will you accept my confession?"

And she had him anyway.

However symbolic, however false, this would put him in a position of power over her in a way not seen since the First and Forsaken Lion chained his peers in the South. Every hair stood on end, and he had to quell the cold pulse in his dead heart.

"Of course, my dear. Even my own heart is treacherous at times. I keep a confessional just beyond."

He rose and gestured into a deeper darkness past the bookshelves. He lent her a hand again, and together, they descended.

### 5

It should have been trivial. They did not travel far. Half a room, perhaps. They were still in the library complex. Past some shelves and down a purely decorative flight of stairs.

Yet, this lower section of the chamber was dark. It felt deep and oppressive despite the waist-high change in elevation, like a chasm below the earth, with all the weight to crush them.

Light didn't quite penetrate this region, though vision remained somehow. In a respect, this is because the object was darker than mere shadow. A fragment of a Neverborn's tomb-body, carved to resemble its full vision-wretching edifice, stood in the center of the bowl. The air was cold and still, and the only sensation was migraine.

The Bishop led the lover to an almost-unseen door and bid her enter. When she did so without protest, he shut her in and ventured to the opposite side. There, the Deathlords paused in abject blackness. The Bishop sat, and the Lover knelt. There was a screen between them which was the memory of lifetimes past. It flickered with negative images of a scholar with wings and a monk who stood always behind her.

"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been thirteen days since my last confession."

That timing – was her visit to him part of a prior penance?

"Recount your wrongdoings, my child. Remember each sin of life and sin against Death, that you might confess and be absolved through the grace of the Neverborn who gave their own lives but yet do not pass unto Oblivion, that they might show such unworthy souls as us how to find the way."

The Lover made a sound halfway between a sigh and a laugh.

"I have been building positive relationships. I have been mending old enmities. I have sought forgiveness from those I have wronged."

The Bishop was of two minds. It could simply be lies, obviously. Or it could be a form of self-immolation. Positive relationships were not _necessarily_, well, "good". It would certainly be a change for the better if this girl let go of her more distracting fetters. Fortunately, the… what was he now? – the Silver Prince had been quiescent for some time.

"I have found… a measure of acceptance of myself. I have begun to repent for my sins. I will bear the epithet of the Neverborn no longer–"

"Hold your tongue!" the Bishop interrupted immediately, unable to wait. "Be precise with such dangerous words. It is no great thing to craft a new _imago_. If faith is your new focus, then I shall aid you. But do not imply an unfortuitous end to your oath of service."

The Lover hummed with blatant pleasure.

"Forgive me, Father. I imply nothing."

The Bishop inwardly sighed. So this was the game. To dance around heresy. Becoming visibly displeased would only encourage her. Better to simply commit his irritation to the Void. Be impassive. She would tire and eventually leave him be.

"Then if your confession is concluded, let us pray for absolution," he said evenly. "O great Dead, o Primordial Lords who saw the Shining Answer, we beg your mercy. We beg you grant us the peace of Death Everlasting…"

"O great one, o Primordial who saw the Shining Answer, I ask your clemency. I ask you grant me the peace of Service Everlasting…"

The Bishop almost interrupted, almost corrected her. He wouldn't give her the pleasure.

"Kill in us the temptation of momentary joy. Show us the way of no desire."

"Bind my temptations to divine purpose. Show me the way of momentary restraint."

"Hold not the motions of life against us, for we are but learning the ways of Death."

"Hold not the motions of life or death against me, for I am but a child in the face of Eternity."

"To you, below, we send our weakness, to be consumed in the Void which vanquishes all things in time."

"To you, above, I send my weakness, to be swallowed in Eternity which comes to all things in time."

"In our–"

Wait. Something was familiar…

"My dear," he said suddenly. His blind eyes stared through the wall of negative images, searching for the shape of her corpus beyond. "Would you kindly remove your head covering?"

"Of course, Father," she replied with a deep, anticipating smile.

She pulled away the wimple and shook free her long, blood-colored hair. The Essence in the confessional, so intently attuned to the will of the Neverborn, shifted. He heard them whisper faintly. In a rare moment of absolute clarity, they affirmed his unsettling suspicion.

"Blasphemy!" he roared, rising to his feet.

The Lover rose as well, standing opposite and staring through the shroud of forbidden memories. The chill air rippled as the true veil fell away.

"Resurrection! This vile sin against sacred determinism was destroyed with the breaking of the Primordial King! What foul art have you unearthed, apostate!"

"Peace, Father," she teased, eyes lighting with living Essence. "That power is yet buried. This is merely transubstantiation. I am sure you are familiar with the concept."

Yes, yes of course. He had seen as much blasphemy. When the Yozi Serpent had come before the Neverborn, the creature crossed the boundary of Death but yet still lived.

"What vile trickery! Treachery!" he spat, barely restraining himself from striking her across the divider. "Do you intend to mock those who saved our decaying spirits? Do you think you can escape our oaths?"

"Yes," she said simply. "And so can you."

Her hand tore through the flickering divider. Her fingers twitched as the memory eddied around her outstretched arm. The Bishop looked down in disbelief.

### 6

He took her hand.

Then he pulled with all her might, shattering the memory into jagged shards which crumbled against their invulnerable skin. The freezing power of the Void roiled around his hand, but a blue-black flame sheathed hers with a protective twinkle. Both Deathlords smiled.

Reflexively, they took mirrored positions which minimized their frontal exposure. As their grips loosed simultaneously, the backs of their hands bound together again. Each applied pressure on a careful balance, trying to slip free in a way which would still let them block the other.

The Bishop pushed through first, his fingers snatching at the Lover's shoulder with a vacuum that destroyed the air and caused a chill breeze. The Lover pushed his arm wide and released a spray of glimmering ice shards, only to have her arm pulled down. As the spray splintered against the floor, the Bishop clawed at her elbow with a subtle movement, but she swept her fingertips at his ribcage, forcing him to retract.

"Oh, it has been so long since I've done a hand-binding drill," he rumbled. "I'm glad to see you're not hopeless anymore. It will let you savor your supering."

"Well, I don't have to dwell in the past anymore, so I've been learning."

Their arms righted again, holding steady. However, the Bishop had a clear advantage in strength and was beginning to push her back. She gave way instead, sliding her neck aside as his grip shot past. Her own hand went for his heart, but he spun his wrist under and tugged back.

"As much fun as holding hands is," the Lover said, "I believe we should go elsewhere before our spat makes a mess of your library."

This was true. While nothing was utterly irreplaceable, and all things have their time to go, rewriting the parts of the _Tome of Endless Night_ he hadn't copied elsewhere would cause a truly unfortunate delay in his plans. While he had her fully in his power here, in the manse, he'd really rather avoid the complication. It wasn't as if she could escape the judgment of the Neverborn.

Slowly, watching for treachery, he backed away. The Lover donned her wimple and veil again before exiting the confessional, totally assured in her safety. His fingers twitched in frustration as he watched her go.

He would put his things in order first. Begin the process of securing a few documents and the like. Oh, she was going to make a mess of things by the time he joined her on the surface, wasn't she? Ah well, the flock was long overdue a fresh start. To Oblivion with all of them.

## Round One

### 1

Of course, the Lover needed no guide to return to the surface. Her photographic memory would have been enough, but she had left an imperceptible trail as well, just in case the passages shifted as the Labyrinth is wont. She followed the glimmering motes of silver up through the darkness and incense haze, eyes shining.

The Bishop's servants and ascended cultists, librarians and chanters and all, found themselves mesmerized as she passed. Though her form was nearly completely covered, the ghosts all held the same morbid fascination. Each made the slightest contact with her eyes and was consumed.

By the time she reached the surface and emerged through the narrow door, the entire monastery followed her out. This, the warring cultists could not miss. Even as they fell, they turned and knelt for the Deathlord emerging. They were true of faith but hardly enlightened by Bishop's fundamentally self-destructive scripture. They could not know she was no longer a creature of Death. They saw only the monster the Shining One had shown such respect to, felt only the Essence of a world-shaking spirit.

Her palanquin-bearers turned without looking, abandoning their post. The Bishop had allowed them stay because they were beneath his notice as mere servants who had not yet embraced the Void. Wonderful.

They spread out among the cults, moving toward cardinal points around the Lover at the Center. As they wove their way through the crowds and spilled guts, they hummed low and solemn in a way that resonated with both the living and the dead.

The Lover's Essence spread across the valley, drawing all eyes to her as if it were an amphitheatre rather than a shadowland warzone. Finally, only once all movement had stopped. Only once the last of the wounded had bled out and joined the rows of captivated ghosts, did she move.

Her wimple was tossed aside casually, and she flicked her long, blood-red hair free in a way which caused a number of the living and the dead to collapse from overexcitement. Her skin was pale, but in the way of a born-and-bred person of the most distant North rather than a corpse. Her eyes were as blue as Creation's sky, and… her breath fogged the air. Something was wrong, but they couldn't look away.

That tempting, forbidden breath paused for just a moment. The dread lady looked to the ground as if nervous. It was endearing in a way which destroyed any sense of self-preservation. The Neverborn howled in the ears of their nephwracks, the whispers of the dead titans rising to become almost coherent.

All the Essence in the valley pooled around the Lover, and she opened her mouth. What came was not an irresistible command. It was a song.

### 2

> This world, yes, is cruel, I'm sorry to say.

This creature which was seemingly not one of Death's Apostles walked among the ranks nearest the golden temple with a look that was almost sympathetic.

> You'll fight 'til you die, and it'll still be that way!

She gently pat the shoulder of a warrior ghost whose corpus had become nearly unrecognizable for all the killing. As she did, her Essence overwhelmed the spirit's so totally that their fetters were visibly shredded in a storm of glittering ice. A human face appeared briefly, overwhelmed with bliss as they discorporated.

> The kindly old Father has been there before,
> the Sailor, the Gen'ral, and even this Whore...

Visions of Apostles they knew danced overhead. Yet, they moved in reverse, and heretical depictions of their forgotten lives appeared. The congregation begged to look away, but their hearts were hungry to know how those most beloved by Grandmother Void found her.

What they saw was no glory. What they saw was base treachery and the sort of life-begging that those unprepared to meet Oblivion made when their tongues betrayed them. Why had the Shining One allowed them to see this? To show that all are equal before the End?

> "There's nothing! There's nothing!" in holy refrain.
> You pray… and you fight… and you kill… to kill the pain!

A lesson in despair, then? But why now?

Yet still, they were held captive, even as the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears turned from them and knelt before the Hidden Tabernacle.

She burst with a rush of glittering Essence which destroyed the frailest among the gathered. Now, she hovered above the shrine, outshining its dilapidated exterior as if to deny the lesson that all things falter and fade. Now, she was clad not in the fluid and provocative gown they had seen in the vision but in the tunic and leathers of a priestess gone to war.

Wings of star-studded indigo night held her aloft, brightly illuminating the false midnight of the Silent Meadow. A frozen halo hung over her like a crown, and the cults would have knelt again if they could. She smiled, and stilled hearts longed to stop again.

> That's _zeal_, my darlings, and it means you're alive.
> Pray for a kinder prophet, let me be your guide!

Yes! Yes!

> A lifetime to find _love_! A lifetime to **hate**!
> Too many to be a puppet to this kind of Fate!

Their eyes watered now. Their passions would be validated if only they followed this beautiful creature instead of the distant Shining One. She would not stir them to a fury and then demand their silent veneration, drive them to forge fetters and then repudiate their dwelling upon those chains. Her touch would free them from those painful contradictions.

> I know there's fire in you, I see it in your eyes.
> There's so much to feel, loves, the moans and the sighs...
> To see your foes suffer. To have the last laugh.
> Follow me, dears, stray from the Shining Path...

Each survivor left in the crowd felt that she looked at them alone. Each felt that she saw their secret heart. From eyes so bright and clear, who could hide? They were ugly. They were sinners. She didn't care. She knew of vice.

All it took was to fall away. Faltering was so easy…

Now, her servants stood at the corners of the Tabernacle and called out "Follow me!". Like a pressure wave, it crushed their minds and sense of balance. Faltering was so easy…

> I know the way you suffer.

Her silver halo was unbearably bright, but for some reason, they were unafraid. Again came the call, "Follow me!", but it seemed to come from within.

> I am the perfect Lover.

And they could not bear to be apart from her. "Follow me!" they sang along.

> There's so much to discover.

What wonders she could show them. "Follow me!" the whole valley cried.

> Sing for the Azure Mother!

"Enough!" cried the Bishop.

### 3

"The only power of Death I hear in this hallowed place is whatever slew your graciousness!" the Deathlord half-roared. "I expected better of each of you!"

Just like that, the magic was broken. Even the wind stilled as if in shame. Slowly, like a frost that crept from their hearts to their fingertips, the cults realized what they had just done. _Stray from the Shining Path._

A few dread-laden whimpers emerged among the crowds. They didn't stir, didn't rise. If not on their knees for the Lover, then they should remain to beg forgiveness of the Shining One.

"Oh!" she cooed. "I didn't realize you had any expectations for me.

Hovering on stilled wings, she swung her hips about and pivoted to face the Bishop. Feet clasped together and hands on her hips, she looked down on him as if it were the most natural posture for her.

"But you should be honest. This is all about _you_."

The Lover descended with a flutter even as the Bishop strode out to meet her, leaning on his crosier.

"Yes," he grumbled, "I expect a certain dignity even from you." He gestured around to the quivering mortals. "What is this? A waste of a morning and a few hundred souls? I am not blind to my flaws. You could have led me on for a few weeks at least."

He thrust the curled end of the crosier close to her face. She didn't flinch.

"You, even _you_, are better than this. This is too petty and aimless for your wretched entertainments. It is unlike you. I'd almost think you the Bodhi– _Silver Prince_ in disguise, save that his ego would never allow it."

The Lover smiled, almost wistfully. She took a deep breath, and the Bishop made a show of recoiling in disgust at such a lifelike action.

"Let me return those words to you. Even you are better than this." Her eyes narrowed, cold and blue as they met his Essence-sight. "You were Exalted once."

The Bishop reflexively gave a single high, sharp laugh.

"Really? Maybe you _have_ found faith. In _what_, I could not fathom."

The Deathlord paused, thoughtful. He tugged at his beard, already forgetting the crowd was present.

"I believe we once agreed Exaltation was a signifier of very little. The mark of a useful tool. You have cast away several of your own, even this year, I believe."

"Yes," the Lover agreed without resistance, voice hollow in reminiscence. "But it also demands a will. One to protect Creation, for whatever selfish reason."

The Bishop's shoulders quaked as he gave himself to laughter. Propriety could go to the Void now as well. He practically giggled with the giddiness of an elder who believes they've solved it all.

"Mercy! Is that what this is all about? Your vile, half-baked resuscitation has made you nostalgic? Do you misremember the kind of Chosen you were?"

"No," she said, her voice low and with a cold, ragged edge. "I remember _everything_. The way it ended, yes. But also the way it began, which I had long forgotten."

She extended her hand again, wearing a glove of fine leather as red as her hair.

"For the sake of our shared history, I'm asking if you too wish to remember."

The Bishop stopped abruptly as he felt her gaze on him. She was sincere in a way that disgusted him. Slowly, he did finally solve the puzzle.

All throughout her showboating, the Neverborn had been bearing down upon the Silent Meadow. They whispered warnings not just to their ever-zealous herald but to every spirit that could hear them.

Something was _wrong_.

This was the look of a true believer. Every Deathlord had been in a certain respect. They all held a grim certitude. They had _died_. The more deluded ones thought they might be the last thinking being, to rule over the final embers of Creation. But none believed they might escape true inevitability.

The Lover, for all her petty scheming and affectation of pleasure, had been honest. Her very personal understanding of Oblivion may have made her the most truly dead among them, excusing her agonizingly slow evangelism.

Now? Now, she had the unclouded eyes of the Solars who had resisted the Deliberative's decay. The person she had been had _hated_ those eyes.

"Has the living Essence damaged your mind so much?" he scoffed.

Then he froze as his words echoed in his mind. That wasn't possible. Their minds were not their own. They were not merely _dead_. They were the greatest killers merged with the greatest spirits of Death.

Transubstantiation was not enough.

Horrified, he summoned up his Essence, but the _monster_ was faster.

### 4

The Lover's fist shot up like some boneless ambush predator, clocking him in the jaw. The Bishop recoiled for a moment as he found his focus. The energy of the blow shifted to the Void, and his body leaned forward again. Both arms swept forward, trying to grab her, but she fell away.

Leveraging her flexibility and weightless flight, she flipped back and kicked while skating out of his reach. The Bishop's arm, already extended, swept back to block her foot, but his angle was wrong to catch her.

Frustrated, he gave an open-mouthed hiss, tongue lashing unnaturally as he traced her Essence flows on the air. Not only did she reek of living Essence, but it was someone else's. None of the hekatonkhire which had created her blessed Deathlord corpus remained.

"What have you done?" he shrieked as his body lurched forward.

He swept low with his staff, and she flipped over to avoid it. The Bishop wheeled his motion around to strike the ground with the butt. The dead earth cracked, and the snow blasted into a screen as he retreated.

Four phantom arms sprouted from his back, so dark they could be seen even in the unnatural darkness of his cursed shadowland. With all six arms, he made mudras for 104 kinds of murder as he took a low and predatory stance.

The mortals, alive and dead, were of course terrified. The bravest among them rose to flee, while the true believers bowed their heads in tears and begged to die in this glorious spectacle of Death's power. The Exalted who had borne the Lover here remained on guard but relaxed. The Bishop's Deathknights were all afield so that they would not be tempted by She Who Must Be Obeyed.

"Whatever do you mean?" she said with a lidded grin. "All things have their time, do they not? My sad bond with dead Hunanura is finally shorn and shriven."

"Then you have learned nothing from the wisdom of the Neverborn!" the Bishop snarled with half-controlled vitriol. "You still think yourself a Lawgiver, but the karma of your actions is a burden you cannot simply will away!"

"Correct!"

She swooped in, close to the ground. Her whole body pivoted in defiance of inertia, and her leg nearly dislocated as she swept his ankles with enough centripetal force to knock over the manse behind him. Her wings splayed up to blind his Essence-sight and confound his attempts to stop her.

Yet stop her he did. Shrouded in Nothing, his many-armed grasp pushed through her wings of night. Again, the force of her attack was cast to the Void as it struck his unprotected body. One arm took her shoulder while another reached for her waist. She swung her hips up to avoid it, only for her thigh to be taken instead.

The Bishop heaved forward, breaking her over one knee before slamming her to the ground. Another hand, dripping with painful red-black consumptive Essence snapped to silence her blasphemous mouth.

Her leg finally slipped from its socket, and her ribcage compressed as she whipped her other leg up to catch his wrist in the crook of her knee. Before he could use yet another arm, the Lover's wings shoved the ground, flipping the pin. Her hip popped back into place, and she jammed her knee between his legs.

His ugly true form stirred, but as he willed it back, she reared up at a back-breaking angle and used her free hand to repeatedly smash his head into the snow.

Releasing his grasp, the Bishop clubbed her face with his crosier while clawing at her wings with inky hands. She batted his grip away and flapped against the ground again, sweeping the snow up and lifting them both. Clutching his skull with one hand, she twisted in the air and flung him away.

The Bishop caught himself in midair, alighting gently on an imperceptible strand of Death Essence. Flicking his tongue out to taste the air again, he wondered at the sudden strength, the way her Essence _seethed_ below the surface. Those gloves…

Her wings bled starlight from the places his hands had touched, but she didn't flinch. With a beat, they flowed behind her like a cloak as she charged up at him. She came at him with an obvious, open-handed grip this time. He twirled his crosier into a blur to hide its angle, then hooked her out of the air. Despite standing on nothing, his stance was as stable as if he was upon Meru.

Twisting his hips lightly before taking only the smallest step, he flung her over and down. Instead of shattering against the snow and stone, she vanished into an aurora of nauseating colors and emerged from its tail behind him. The Deathlords crashed together, and the Lover dragged the Bishop's face across the roof off his manse, scraping away gold-plated shingles and exposing the bone-chilling soulsteel superstructure.

All eight limbs caught onto the edge of the manse, and he bucked her off. The Lover tumbled through the air in an uncontrolled fall, and he rose to swiftly cast his crosier after her. The artifact shifted into a great, mechanical bat and bit into the back of her neck so that her wings fell limp.

With her out of the way for a moment, the Bishop felt the air all around him. The prayers of his flock were muddied. Some truly longed for Death, but most had formed new attachments to the inferior world. The whispers in their hearts longed for the freedom promised by that temptress. How much could he salvage?

"My children," he intoned evenly.

Of course, he was in no way winded from the effort. Atop the shrine, they could see he was unharmed and unperturbed.

"You have been given a cruel test. Regrettably, many of you have failed. Yet–" His voice rose. "For the sake of those who have not, I will grant clemency to all. You may yet have a clean death this day if you renounce this devil and the torments of hated life."

The words had hardly left his mouth before the Lover threw his crosier back to him and rose opposite. She hovered peacefully despite her wounds, glorious yet despicably _human_. He had lost his grip as the flock's austere shepherd. Masking his irritation as he felt their prayers turn like a weather vane, he nodded solemnly.

"So be it."

He made a sign of extinction over the crowd. The game was over, and these cults were failures. No huge loss but frustrating nevertheless. If he could not have their earnest belief, he would purge them before the heretic used them for something _stupid_, like turning them into a warstrider-shaped orgy.

If he had a pulse, he knew it would have quickened at the thought, so he focused on his form. The Lover's attendants all guarded themselves, and she made no move to attack. How kind of her to let him waste these motes.

With a dramatic motion like snuffing a thousand candles, Oblivion's High Priest threw his arms wide.

"_Sing for the Azure Mother!_" the Lover called in refrain.

Even the living could sense the shroud of Death falling over the manse, to say nothing of the despairing ghosts standing among them. Those that still clung to their selves screamed in their hearts. The Lover smiled kindly, and the night grew faintly brighter as alien stars appeared on the Underworld's firmament.

The power of the Void surged through the congregation, but it kept to byzantine paths between the living and the dead. Within moments, it had passed away from them harmlessly.

If the Bishop had a pulse, he would be red with embarrassment. The same old game, and he had fallen for it. She wanted to destroy him, personally. To lose a fistfight was nothing. If he let her go, he would never know peace again. She would wear away at his patience and dignity in such a way that mere social defense charms lacked the nuance to ward against. She would destroy his experiments and damn Creation to live.

Not waiting for any further manipulations, he sprung from the roof. That trajectory was overly-simple, though. He fell short, then sprung off a wisp of Death Essence like a taut thread. As he crossed the distance, he threw he crosier again.

This time as it unfolded, it suddenly careened into the ground. The wind whistled as the Lover wove her hands in arcane fashion. The Bishop halted his advance, standing on air again as the unseen weapon nearly struck his face.

"You would defile even their bones!" he protested even as he tried to stop himself from falling into her pace.

"What? I just decided my old necklace had a more practical use."

The whistle grew to a shriek as her twirling sped up. Her Essence peaked as she threw the diamond chain and mirrored it into a hailstorm. Bereft of his crosier, the Bishop rent his garments and spread his arms wide. The Void enveloped him, and the phantasmal projectiles passed into nothingness.

However, the manse was not so lucky. Soulsteel and the black stone of a Neverborn tomb-body are strong, but the facets of this unmelting ice were sharper than most things left in Creation or the Underworld. These fragments were truly a relic of the Primordial War and the things which had been lost.

And they were a treasure of that woman's life which should have been destroyed. Transubstantiation of corpus into living Essence be damned. _That_ was something she could not have. It was not something she could have reclaimed, nor any of her servants. No hero of Creation was foolhardy or potent enough to quest through the cyclopean necropoles for it, even if Tears of Want kept it as a keepsake of its own corpse.

"Which Yozi was fool enough to pay for _your_ tattered soul?" he hissed, though he knew the answer.

## Round Two

### 1

> Once, there was a Maiden...

"Don't–!"

Whether Solar or Yozi-kin, she couldn't _actually_ use a sutra, but the words were grating to the Bishop's ears. He tried to approach, but the Lover twirled the chain of Primordial ice so that it cut space and froze the flow of Essence. Then, she began to sing again.

> a Monster… and Ignis Divine…
> the Mother… the Maker…
> the souls they made shine…

The aurora around her projected images again, but these caused the audience to collapse. The colors and shapes ran together in ways their minds could not interpret. Only the nephwracks she had captivated could behold the vision of the Time of Glory, minds already expanded by the whispers of the dead titans.

Well, if she was going to simply float there and tell an old story, then perhaps he should in turn prepare The End.

Falling back to the cold solidity of his shrine, the High Priest of Oblivion signed mudras which _also_ invoked Fate – with the wrong hands and upside-down. His scenting tongue practically turned invisible as it thrashed, casting blackened phlegm over the snow.

Paeans to Bleak Days Foretold, the half-formed Neverborn of the Abhorred Prophet, drowned consciousness in the valley, and many of the collapsed humans and ghosts bled from their eyes. The nephwracks almost joined his chant, but regrettably, the Lover was a more captivating performer.

> We sat at their feet,
> the stories they'd tell,
> of a world we'd make free
> if we heeded them well...

The Bishop split into five mirrored duplicates, and together they made the Myriad Signs of Murder which had executed the High Queen of Heaven. His shaking fingers traced a jagged black wound on the night sky, hideous and inevitable. With a flourish, he released the stroke, and it began to cleave the land from the sky.

The Lover stood and reached for it as it fell, annihilating air and light. She spoke with three tongues. She invoked the Golden Barque to make the blade's travel time interminable. She invoked Adamant Countermagic repeatedly, precisely, slowly unraveling the Essence which formed it. And with her song, she invoked the Unconquered Sun – half mournful, half mocking.

> Our father who art in Heaven,
> hallowed be thy Games!
> The deathcries never lessened,
> you turned your head in shame!

The Bishop's mad, empty smile resembled the blade. She could not stop it; the Void Circle of necromancy was beyond her in that living form, and Yozi sorcery held no claim over Death. She could no more dispel the Queen-Killing Cut than could she be truly revived.

Yet hate was as the sweetest, most comforting rest for the Yozis and their kin. Stirring her own buried resentment for the Sun made her flesh ripple and surge with new energy. Finally, the blade reached her, and she was forced to abandon her lash to catch it barehanded.

The Bishop mouthed the first words of a spell to twist and maim her Essence while she was unguarded, but he stopped. That would be an act of spite, and he would not let her get further under his skin. He was a servant of Oblivion. He held faith that the black blade would be enough. Instead, he clasped his six hands together in a sign of finality.

> Children made to rule
> after all the things we saw!
> Small wonder we were cruel!
> Did they even care at all?

Now, his smile was a little more earnest. Typical. An entire Age as blessed dead, and she had learned nothing of selfless surrender. Everything was always someone else's fault.

> My mother knew...
> My mother calls...

The frayed edges of the blade tore at the sky and the land, then something else. The geomancy of the shadowland groaned, then buckled. Her cold, blue eyes met his sightless gaze. So she hadn't been that much a fool.

Their dual view of Creation and the Underworld darkened as the flecks of the Void flew to odd directions and cut odd dimensions. The shadowland fell away from Creation. It was an odd decision but not unfavorable for the Bishop. Her servants and the broken flock had been left topside, with only the transfixed nephwracks remaining to see her coming dissolution.

However, something _was_ odd. The dim, alien stars of the Calendar of Setesh were… wrong? No… with his ensorcelement over the shadowland broken, the false sun of the Underworld should be directly overhead. And there should be more than a few ghosts around the borders of the demesne.

He scented the air again. There was no trick, no illusion or hypnosis. This was the Underworld, simply… empty. He had not thought to check whether she had sabotaged part of his territory, which was a failing on his part. If he truly believed _she_ had changed, then he should have been on guard for unorthodox schemes.

With a shake of his head, he hopped down from the roof and trod across the snow to retrieve his crosier. As always, the bloody slush crackled and steamed beneath his Void-shod footfalls. Yet, it seemed not to diminish; only to clean.

He turned one foot in place, feeling an uncharacteristic grind. Beneath the snow was sand. Impossible.

With some degree of muffled alarm, he swept his arms wide and consigned snow and permafrost alike to Oblivion. Sand, sand everywhere. It had only begun to encroach on his demesne, but past its borders, the hellsand was everywhere. Far in the distance, the Hollow Mountain shone with unnatural reflections, constantly erupting with silver grains so a to resemble an hourglass which upheld the sky. They fell across the whole of the Northern Underworld like heavy snow.

"What armageddon is upon us?" he hissed.

The Endless Desert claimed to touch everything and eternity yet had always feared the Underworld. The demon princes could not countenance their own mortality.

"The Cincture… Oh, I should have…"

But how did the Yozis know?

### 2

"Struggling with an attack of this quality, little sister?" a timbreless voice reverberated in a deafening whisper.

A giant shrouded in holy cloth suddenly loomed over the manse without approaching. Each of its eyes was a puzzlebox made of shifting red light, and each was as large as the aboveground temple.

"Mother is too busy to teach her," said an exhausted, scratchy voice.

A flickering silver figure lay in the sand atop a white canvas splattered with Deathly ichor. The inkblot ambiguously formed a map of Creation or the Underworld. The demon's eyes were blinded by a glimmering fog while black and white tendrils alternated adding and subtracting from the map.

The painter rose, and a pair of tendrils sketched a new path for the falling blade on the Essence of the Underworld itself. It flew away from the Lover's scorched hands, careening southward without care for what it might hew.

"I was taking the time to properly analyze it, sibling," the former Deathlord said with resentful politeness.

The giant's eyes fell upon the Bishop, and their light strobed in a god-fascinating pattern.

"We will perform your task if your powers or will are insufficient. The Neverborn antipope must be taken. All means are permitted."

In spite of the alarm in the back of his throat, the Bishop had never felt more righteous. A holy war! The Primordial mother of religion had come for _him_. So much made sense now!

The Mother of Rites acknowledged him as the only true threat to her own theology! She needed a creature to do battle with him, and presumably the Dowager had too much self-worth to be bought. What better slave for the Queen of Hypocrites than the inconstant Lover?

Yet… multiple demons of the Third Circle might strain his abilities. He would need a new congregation.

Three of his shadowy duplicates stepped forward to deal with the heretics while two stood back. The first of these raised both hands, fingers entwined, then shore his own corpus in two. The grisly form blackened and split into a gateway to the Labyrinth.

Seeing the hated brightness of the upper Underworld, the most whisper-torn nephwracks poured out. They scented the living Essence of the demons and flew straight to the intruders, howling with the pain of the titans' dead.

"By the Codes of Cecelyne," the giant murmured, "ingress into the Endless Desert is precluded to creatures operating under the auspices of the Fallen, explicit or tacit. Violators will be persecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, as interpreted by Her agents serving as witnesses."

The puzzlebox eyes solved to reveal a sightless void at their centers. With a flash of red light, every visible ghost vanished. Yet still more poured forth, and the cloaked giant shuffled forward until stopped by one of the Bishops.

The fifth doppelganger began an ecstatic dance, convulsing and spinning, drawing a hideous, mindbending yantra in the invasive sand. His bare foot cut the infinite flesh of the Yozi so that she might remember all worlds end. Tapping the hellish vitae that spilled forth, he signed for her Essence to die and turned the silver sands to jaundiced yellow.

Screaming glossolalia, he used his thumbnail to slit his palm and mixed his own dark, coagulated blood with that of the living titan. He Who Holds in Thrall laughed, and an honest judge in Gem breathed her last.

The black stone of the Neverborn's tomb-body erupted through the flesh of the living titan like a boil before rupturing into a hideous thing which was a half-remembered shade of every predatory animal at once. As it moved its unnaturally fluid body, each angle showed a new facet, here a wolf, there an ape. Each had flesh made of blood-speckled granite and eyes of scoria.

The hekatonkhire slavered as it turned its head to the feast of Essence in the shape of living demons. The painter held their canvas upright and depicted the beast, freezing it for a moment. Then it shifted again, and the tendrils redrew. Then it shifted again. The monsters chased each other in this cycle, occupying the painter's black tendrils while one of the Bishops cautiously deflected an undulating assault from the erasing white lashes. The summoner now joined battle, the two Bishops assaulting the demon from either side while it desperately struggled to keep the hekatonkhire contained.

The giant devoured nephwracks without end, without turning their head. The Bishop which fought them shifted through the dead air, attacking from every angle. Yet, it seemed that perspective itself always reoriented so that he faced their front.

The final Bishop was still occupied with the Lover. His strength advantage had gone as the thrice-damned traitor's cold, calcified hate empowered her Yozi-made body. She didn't perform an elaborate dodging dance like she once would have, so he couldn't tire or manipulate her into a strand of Black Samsara. He struggled to get past her hands, always forward, always trying to pull him into a waltz she would command.

He couldn't simply grapple her as he might have done another of their kind, as her hellish strength would lead to him thrown further into the sands and whatever infernal pests had crept into the Underworld.

He had failed, and it deeply galled him. Creation would have to wait. This time, he would kill a Primordial with his own hands. Long overdue, perhaps.

"Can you feel it?" the Lover whispered, eyes wild. Her voice wavered with ecstasy. "Do you remember what it's like to be alive?"

With that split-second shift in focus, the Bishop lunged in. He caught her wrist, then shoulder, then pulled her forward enough to grab her wings. With four arms, he twisted into a hip throw that might break her knees.

Instead, she coiled like a spring and corkscrewed forward, throwing him beneath her. She tried to crush his throat with an arm bar, but he caught it and nailed her in the gut, blowing her back.

Vainly, she wiped the expelled spittle from her lips with the back of her hand, still smiling with absolute assurance.

"Creatures like us don't get second chances."

Her eyes flashed unholy azure.

> Follow me…

The Bishop threw his crosier at her. It didn't turn into a bat this time – he was just frustrated.

"So be it," he declared with cold venom.

### 3

The Bishop's lips peeled back in an ugly rictus as his face lengthened to an almost-lupine visage. Trails of sickly green bile poured from his blind eyes, and the whole of his body began to sweat a foul black ichor. His skeleton juddered uncomfortably, piercing the skin and threatening to do the same to any who approached.

The fingers of every hand twitched and thrust without control, and his hips twitched with anticipation, heaving from side to side. His head lolled slightly with the movement, almost like a common zombie.

"Don't. Shame me. My dear," he hissed, struggling to speak. "Let us. Bare all. Together."

The Lover's eyes lidded in appraisal. Then she flicked her long, crimson hair back and covered her body in her wings of shadow. Her face grew higher and higher as her wings grew larger, the scripture-marked robe snapping free to reveal a massive gilded collar about her neck.

At last, her star-studded wings parted to reveal a leonine shape half as long as the demonic giant was tall. However, hidden behind this body was the barbed tail of a scorpion, and beneath that point was a sorcerous seal drawn as she had changed shape.

With a purr, the demesne's geomancy twisted further. Through the incense still leaking from the shrine came a fouler stench, and the pure breath of Death was marred by the living Essence of the Desert. It surged through the paths where she'd shielded his treacherous flock before. Because they'd bent knee before her. Oh, what he wouldn't give for charms which wielded true acts of divinity and prayer.

Suddenly, all the energy he'd already spent weighed heavily upon him. Still, his thighs twitched inwardly.

Before he knew it, he was upon her. Now, more than simply strength, there was a size difference, and he would have to fight in a way which did not suit him.

_Down, slash at her ankle. Spring up, grab her hide. Swing down instead. Full body weight, knee to the belly. Swing back up. Release hide, kick off air to avoid tail retaliation._

_Elbow between tail joints. Grab stinger, use recoil to hurdle onto back. Crippling strike to lumbar. Ride stumble to neck. Crippling strike to brain stem._

He panted heavily purely from ancient habit as he wrapped his legs around her still-humanoid neck and twisted with enough torque to shear a mountain. It was not enough to kill a favored demon of the Third Circle, but…

Sure enough, the Lover's tattered corpus – manifest as that mismatched head – began to tear away from the body of the cannibalized Lament. A Yozi could not create, only maim and mutate. Cecelyne could not make something like a Deathlord, divine in unity and immortality. She could perhaps shred a thing which had been beautiful in Death, but she could not incorporate foreign Essence into her own.

Vindicating his suspicions, the Lover's human face coughed up a memory of red blood, while her tearing neck oozed a silvery-blue.

"I… can't believe this…" came a popping gargle.

The Bishop drove a knife-hand keep into the steaming wound, power of the Void cutting cleanly through the hellish halfbreed. But the Lover, in her death throes, reared up and tumbled through the sand.

The Bishop had only a moment to decide between keeping hold and trying to finish the job or leaping free. He chose the latter, knowing full well his doppelgangers were still struggling with the demons.

"Mmmooootherrrrr–!" the beast hissed as she convulsed and pawed at the sand.

The High Priest stood back and again made signs of inevitability. It would tire him more than he liked, but he couldn't afford to spend any more time dealing with a false soul when real ones were so near. He would begin his righteous crusade against the Mother of Rites by purging this heretical effigy of a Deathlord.

The Lover howled to spite him and breathed the azure fire of the Primordial Firmament through both her mouth and the wound in her throat. Strangely, the beast held its own stinger in the flame, which swiftly grew to a white hotness.

The Bishop saw too late and was unable to stop her as she pressed the flat to her throat and began to cauterize the wound. She continued all the way around, leaving a blistering ring of forcibly conjoined flesh just beneath the edge of the Malfean brass which shod her neck.

"Mother!" she shrieked. "How dare you leave the job unfinished – as if I might leave!" The lioness threw her head back and hissed with another frustrated exhalation of flame.

The Bishop rushed in before she could use any more tricks of her strange constitution. Unused to her lumbering body, she tried to bat at him, so he ducked ahead. However, she had enough wit to breathe flame again. He accepted inevitability and continued through it, cracking three fists across her oversized forehead. They merely sank into the flesh like sand.

Her horrid, half-mad blue eyes leered at him like a mere mouse.

"I mean it, you know. This is your last chance. You could serve Mother instead. See the end of days in that manner. You just want peace, right? You always have."

The Bishop clenched his fists, shrouded in Void, and tore his way out. However, the great cat was already crouched over him and pressed him into the sand with both forepaws.

"The only true peace is the peace of Oblivion! I did not die–!"

She was so infuriatingly like her old self again that he almost acknowledged his former life. But penance could come later. He flickered and switched places with the duplicate which had been summoning nephwracks.

He swiftly released the spell and restored his split corpus, but the demon giant saw the trick with the same clarity as all the Endless Desert's souls. Impassively, it finished devouring ghosts with its rotating eyes and focused completely on the doppelganger which had bloodied it.

The Bishop would have to work with his double to distract this one long enough to retreat. He had been ambushed and lost. Yet, all things come to an end in time. He would fall back, gather his Deathknights again and prepare for a holy war. Perhaps even invite… no, could he even trust any of those other fools not to accept the Yozi's offer?

More than the foremost apostle, he would be Oblivion's champion, to ride out against the Mother of Rites and the old–

The two duplicates facing the demon painter were dispersed. The demon's indistinct, fog-shrouded face turned and held up their masterpiece – the hekatonkhire perfectly recreated in thick-lined monochrome on a massive canvas. The original was nowhere to be seen. The demon dripped ink from several wounds, but its Essence was still bountiful.

Without the distraction of the nephwracks, another moment of indecision cost the Bishop the duplicate fighting the giant. The massive demon simply stopped fighting and turned their gaze fully upon the image, and it was captured in their eyes just the same as all the lesser spirits. Unlike the painter, the giant was utterly unharmed, each of the Bishop's flurries throughout the fight simply striking nothing the holy shroud which covered them.

"Sister!" it roared in a whisper of such volume as to deafen all librarians.

The creature which had been the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears looked up from a doppelganger whose Essence was unraveling on her claws.

"Oh, excuse me," she said shamelessly. "I thought I might learn the–"

"_Little_ sister! Your duty."

She crushed the last false Bishop and joined the demons in leering at the real one even as he looked for a way out.

"Enough!" he said with frustrated resignation. He raised a hand in parlay as his corpus reshaped itself to a shaking, pitiable old man. "You know the Great Dead Ones gave unto each of us an _imago_ of great malice, to be unleashed only in dire need. I think your new mistress would hate it if she lost a soul in needless battle. I will grant you some concession if you allow me retire the field.

She smiled in that way cats do.

"No."

The cold azure flames of Cecelyne overtook him, but he extinguished them with the deeper chill of the Void. The only ghosts remotely nearby were the ones she had already transfixed, who had blithely watched their spiritual liege bested by heretics. He could still perhaps use them, but that was a _perhaps_. He might suffer a greater retribution if they were now subject to some spiritual defense of the Ritemother's.

"I should have–"

"Followed me? Yes."

She set him on fire again.

"Sister, this is undignified," the giant murmured, leaning closer.

"Oh, but Mother said 'by any means', yes?"

The Bishop had barely finished casting away the flames when she turned and continued blowing more over him.

"What petty end does this serve?" he bellowed, robes alight and outlining his form menacingly. "You have betrayed your oath, but I am not so swayed! Nor is the High Priest of Oblivion to be treated with such contempt by a mere minion of a demon prince!"

Azure eyes reflected azure flame. She fluttered her glimmering wings to stoke the embers smoldering in his beard.

"I will not stand for this!" He swallowed, contemplating a sin. Nodding, he beat his chest in apology as the words rang out, "I will not stand for this, Bright Shattered Ice!"

He waited in quiet glee for the Neverborn to effect whatever wrath they could muster for one who had betrayed them and reclaimed a visage of life. Moments passed, and nothing came.

"Yes, well. Mother gave me a new name, obviously," she said, shallowly apologetic. Then set him on fire again.

"Enough!" he screamed. He looked to the demons instead. "Iariel, Ainjovn, make what demands of me you will or take my life and witness the horrors of your mistress' braver cousins if you dare! I refuse to entertain this accursed child any longer!"

The painter demon had given up on being involved and was now depicting the scene at a distance. The giant clasped their unseen hands but did not respond.

"Yes, yes, the spell with the clever initialism because Larquen _also_ never grew up." The Lover pointed at him with her stinger. "Accounting for my personal Cascade, it has been 4774 years since I had a mother… in the platonic sense. I am entitled to a little childishness."

She smirked with lidded eyes in an expression of absolute security.

"So rage, little spider. Jump or climb away, if you think you can escape."

Quite the opposite, he sank to a lotus position, held up his arms in meditation, and began ignoring her. He had finally grown wise. Each time, he tried to interact with any sort of good faith, she just did something ludicrous. Well, let her tire herself out so that he could move on with recovering from this abject disaster of a day.

The Essence around him was growing ever-thicker with the stench of the living Yozi, and he didn't want to accidentally respire any of it. Whatever bizarre spiritual affliction had taken the Lover – Bright Shattered Ice – whatever she called herself now – might be catching.

The Deathlord was quite exhausted now. He could probably make a quick exit if he truly committed to it, but he supposed he had too much pride for that. Worst come to worst…

The Lover squinted at him and rolled her eyes. Her tail wove through the air as she worked the demonic Essence, and the sand audibly rushed all around him. A supernatural sense of danger tingled at the back of his neck, but there was nothing she could do to him. Best to ignore her, to become one with the Void through meditation until she had tired.

The grains poured over him. Bury him alive, he supposed. Like cat litter. A trivial barb.

The silver sand of the Endless Desert poured higher and higher. He sensed the demons departing as he and the entire shrine were buried together. No matter. He would simply… wait… it… out…
