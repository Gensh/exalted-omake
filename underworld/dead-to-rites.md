# Dead to Rites

**Content warning:** suicidal ideation

## 1

Much of the Labyrinth is darkness beyond darkness.

A perpetual midnight of isolation and betrayal trails in the wake of the Shadow of All Things. Yet, the shadows' derision of taking a set form; their slimy, inkiness; makes them reflect a glimmer of whatever faint light chases them. One can take a thin comfort in knowing the Ebon Dragon exists only in opposition.

Deeper into the Labyrinth, such emotions slowly die.

It is dark, and nearly everything is an ugly and flat gray stone, and there is something about it that strikes one as unnatural. None of this is uncommon for those who see such accursed landscapes. In that, the dreams of the ever-dying are insidious.

One does not immediately notice that the gray stone neither reflects nor scatters light, that it simply dies. The Green Sun of Hell casts a middling light without shadow, which makes the perpetual noon of the demon realm seem nigh-overcast. Yet personal lights still cast reflections and may make their own darkness. The Labyrinth seems almost a reverse – light scarcely travels, and the shadows only deepen.

Neither is there cool clamminess like a natural cave. Some parts may evoke memories of such, but those things are foreign and will one day be extinguished by the shifting of the haunted chasms. The Labyrinth is bland in its oppressiveness. When it is not stirred to incarnate nightmare by some horror stalking its halls, it is subtle. This is the realm of the dreaming dead, and it takes life in the manner of sleep.

The Venous Stair forgoes pretension. It is a shade darker, an hour cooler than the surrounding stone. Its geometry is more blatantly unsettling, the downward spiral twisting at an angle sharper than is strictly possible. When one steps on the stone, no echo comes. The way is narrow, and the path well-trod, but one will never meet another soul upon the Stair. It is the lonely walk to The End, the Longest Descent.

Yet now, it has begun to bend outward.

The formless dread wafting in from the haunted tunnels beyond its many landings are repelled by a cacophony today. No sound echoes from the surrounding stone; it is swallowed in the harsh corners of the Stair and vanishes.

To spite the death of sound, the forty-two trumpeters have their shackles loosed. Today, they need not silently jockey and strive to overcome the others without creating discord. Each exhales the breath of life into their instrument without care, for there is no longer need for restraint in this place of End.

The two-score-and-two horns compel the dream of the Stair wider. The choir sings "Make straight the way of the Lady!" and the Stair is compelled to obey. The unnatural angles of the dead-dreamed passage turn at the vigorous demand of the living, and its tight curve unwinds to become nearly imperceptible. Yet the descent is no slower for the gentler curve and slope.

---

Down and down the Stair passed the procession of demons.

"Everyone knows" that spirits fear the lands of Death more than mortals do. To them, it is like walking into a place where the only air is toxic volcanic gas. Yet still, the trumpeters blew and the choir sang. The guards marched around all, armor of red glass glinting like flowing lifeblood in the light of the bobbing lanterns held aloft by tall, gangly demons.

At the center of the procession was a palanquin borne by a scorpion hewn from azurite, and on the seven corners stood veiled priests who swung chimes as if to drive back the encroaching gray. At the fore was a creature neither demon nor specter yet appeared as a charred skeleton. Its skull and robes constantly burned a ghastly blue, and it carried a banner showing the Chalice of Hours which was illuminated by its own conflagration.

All about was the stench of incense, citrus, and vanilla, to honor the Lady and to make an overabundance of sensation which might hold back the totality of death. The demons who did not perform instead spoke amongst themselves and offered prayers to the enshrined deity.

Only once did one of the great dead Traumas-That-Walk approach the Stair. When the beast of stone and shackles approached the party, it knelt upon its foundation, sending the thousand souls within it crashing against its walls. The Standard-Bearer raised an imperious hand, and the prison-beast made obeisance to the triangular silhouette behind the curtain of the palanquin. A tongue of blue flame lit upon its many-cornered apex, and it departed to share its cruel joy – the Queen of Fetters is come!

The Longest Descent was shorter than ever. The trumpets drowned out any one demon's ability to despair or to contemplate the End. The chimes kept rhythm; no performer faltered. The choir reminded each spirit, both in the procession and in the tunnels beyond, that death was no escape, that all things ever-are beneath the Primordial Expanse and set in her shining eyes.

At last, the Stair came to an end. There was a final landing to the right and a final step to the left. That way lay Oblivion, and though many spirits who made the Descent took that step, the way of the procession was fixed in hell's astrology.

As it emerged from the relative safety of the Stair, the lamps flickered and dimmed. Only the cold light of the Standard-Bearer's self-immolation remained strong. An overwhelming sense of peace fell over the procession, the quiet certitude of The End. Yet in its grasp, they redoubled their efforts. The horns blew louder, the chimes shaken more vigorously, more incense lit. There is no peace in hell, and its seeming appearance precedes disaster.

The ghastly chamber in which they found themselves was at once small and terrifically large. The marching demons struggled to keep position as their depth perception fluctuated. Each felt a keen sense of distance and isolation, yet on reaching out in panic, found they were already breathing down the neck of their nearest companion. The sacred palanquin which kept them truly safe seemed miles away, even for those who set a fearful hand on the resentful scorpion which bore it.

The Standard-Bearer waved in silence, and the congregation parted. Standing next to one of the spindly lantern-bearers for more light, it unfurled a papyrus scroll. The choir looked to it and began to sing:

> Remember the lost days
> Remember the last face
> You saw
> Before you marched to war
> Remember, remember the bliss of grace
>
> Remember before Time
> Remember your lifeline
> The friend
> On whose words you'd depend
> Remember, remember dear Cecelyne

As the choir at last fell silent in the echoless chamber, the matte black stone turned to reflectionless ice. Black snow fell from the chasm ceiling with no sign of clouds. The flakes landed upon them and melted to a red fluid which stank of rotten flesh. The path ahead roiled like a mirage and turned from a cliffside trail to a steep, jagged stair.

Above, a burial mound emerged from the ceiling like a boil. Atop it was a circular slate altar surrounded by monoliths bearing indistinct reliefs. Upon the stone was pinned the shining bones of something great and inhuman. Its shape could scarcely be divined beneath innumerable bloodstained cranes who did not seem to care for gravity. Each gave a screeching, whooping call and burst into flames before a new one emerged from a snowflake caught in the conflagration.

Where there had been the silence of the grave, there was now a new cacophony as the cranes multiplied without end. Where there had once been stillness, the sensation of snow and ashes breaking upon one's skin was unavoidable. This was a more familiar kind of terror, and some of the demons nearly broke.

Then the curtain parted.

A flood of glittering silver sand flowed from the palanquin. It piled on the snowy ground and trickled beyond, reflecting the blue light of the Standard-Bearer even as it fell into the eternal darkness of Oblivion.

With a soft crunch, a pair of boots set upon the sand. A tall, broad-shouldered woman emerged, wearing robes depicting an alien sky and tortured stars. On either side of a her head, ram's horns curled into the Sign of Forever. Tied to the horns were the cups of a scale, swaying in judgment with the slightest tilt of her head. Wide eyes of a sickly amber pierced the darkness.

She raised a hand in the way the Standard-Bearer had been imitating. Only her face had skin. Her gesturing hand was an infinite void which seemed full of light compared to the true Void just below. The darkness dripped silver, sand pouring down her arm and sleeve like blood from stigmata.

"Hello, Hunanura."

Cecelyne took one step, and the congregation parted. Then she took another and slipped through the intervening space to the base of the newly-formed stairs. The scales hanging from her horns swayed from the motion, even though the air remained still. With each step up the spindly, crooked stair, her body seemed to remain perfectly still. It was as if she was shifting the whole of the Labyrinth instead of moving herself.

Midway to the top, gravity reversed, and her extended foot hung in the air as if she might tumble. When she brought it down, the demons below seized themselves, fearful she might flip the realm and send them crashing onto the altar above. Moments more, and the Yozi stood there herself. She looked up, which was to say down upon her servants, and they bowed and said "Amen".

The cranes picking at the meatless bones shrieked at her. With an imperious grimace, she raised one hand.

"Begone."

They each gave a single final unified cry whose collective volume would have been unbearable if the cavern had echoes. Then at once, they exploded into a rain of gore which soaked the procession.

The Yozi, infinite in nature and possessing suitable patience, groaned and pressed both hands to her face. Of _course_ telling a creature of Death to go away would make it kill itself. Her mind ground like the wheels of a mill, the two halves processing this knowledge into predictions.

Atop the altar was a massive, vaguely humanoid skeleton, save that the bones were made of ivory ice. A pall of fog hung over the slate altar, emanating from the body as it lay spread eagle. Its sternum was missing, ribs crumbling inward as if the chest had recently been crushed. Cecelyne knew that wound. She had seen it bleed. It had simply remained that way all this time.

Beneath the slab was a double door of the same stone. The Yozi approached with an impassive expression. She touched its faceless surface with three fingers, and it opened inward. Unhesitating, she stepped into the narrow, lightless corridor. The doors shut behind her, and the seam between them and the wall vanished, cutting her off from both light and prayer.

---

Reflexively, Cecelyne snapped and held up an azure flame to illuminate the tunnel. She didn't need to do it, as her own wastes stretched eternities from Ligier's glow, but old habits die hard.

The interior was at once wet and dry. It was all white and glimmered faintly. Her boots clung to the floor, and her immaterial fingers had an awful tackiness to them where they had touched the stone.

Shuddering, she pointed down and let sand grind over her hand, scouring it to the bone to let the plasm reform. The numbness was almost nostalgic, but the visual of the process left a nagging discomfort in the primitive part of her mind.

Still, one could never be too careful with the taint of Death. Speaking of which, she would have to be careful. Her charms would be–

Ledaal Kebok Zaemon snapped awake. He was still at his desk. Fuck, he really needed to sleep more regularly. Just one more report to fill out for his Lord Cousin, and he could… There were five there now.

He took a deep breath and stood halfway. Then he thought better of it and sat back down immediately. Having shifted from his calcified position, now his back and ass hurt. More importantly, he pinched his wrist and kneaded the palm of his hand, trying to restore the circulation and keep it from cramping.

Fuck, okay.

Stretching as best he could, he opened a drawer and drew out the phial containing the last dregs of his Chiaroscurit wakefulness tincture. The combination hiss and growl that came from his throat did not do justice to his feelings on both the taste and that he was nearly out. Just barely enough to mix one more tea.

He paused for a moment, staring at it.

Then he thumbed off the cap and gulped it down at once. He shuddered and clawed at his unshaven face, but got back to work with renewed vigor.

The figures weren't _hard_; the work was just unearthly boring. Even if there weren't so much of it, he'd be struggling to focus on any of it without the stimulant.

Fuck, it was hot for this time of year. His eyes went to the open window. He held a hand up. Freezing. Just him, then. Shit.

He touched the back of his hand to his forehead. Not feverish but certainly warm. He shook his head. Not now. Once he was finished with all this garbage.

And honestly! None of it was actually important! And the servants could do it all if His Glorious Exalted Lordship would use his Mela-Blessed Wisdom to–

Fuck, it was hot.

Zaemon pressed two fingers to the vein in front of his ear. Heart hadn't stopped yet. HIs chest was certainly clenching now, though.

Nothing wrong with him, the family doctor had said. Just let the fits pass. And if something did go wrong, it was just his time. Mela was calling him early.

Lord Hesiesh governs the heart, you stupid, faithless–!

He stood abruptly, then turned and began to pace the room, blood screaming in his ears. Of _course_ he'd die alone in the middle of the night because he was abusing stimulants.

Fuck, and the poor servant who would find his body. At this point, he almost welcomed another incarnation, but he didn't want anyone to have to deal with that. Taking a deep breath, he laid down on the unswept wooden floor.

Calm. Let it pass.

---

Cecelyne lowered her fingers from the vein and struck her own chest for spite. The heart beat steadily, pulse raised from adrenaline and nothing else. She almost missed the vile taste of the tincture.

Holding the blue flame before her, she finally started into the tunnel, boots making a horrible sucking sound on the sticky floor.

It was cold in the tunnel, and the material all seemed ice kept on the tip of the melting point. But the texture was wrong, and the shape had odd ridges. Sometimes, the whole tunnel would contract and expand as if she were in the belly of an earthworm.

Unlike the light-devouring black stone of the Labyrinth, whatever this was, it reflected and refracted her flame.

Not "whatever this was". This was the flesh of Hunanura, long trapped just past the edge of necrosis. To a lesser creature, it would seem grand and eternal, but even something as broken as a Yozi would be repulsed by such a state.

Disgust welled in her throat, but she swallowed it.

Only, it wouldn't stay down. A Yozi is born of such revulsion.

Of course they would be–

She grasped her mouth as if to silence the thought. Her reflection in the ice, in the slough, was unfamiliar. She was handsome, if she could be allowed vanity for a moment. The main part of her which indulged that thought was also capable of compartmentalizing that she was admiring herself in a mirror of rotten flesh.

The self-loathing wasn't new, but the self-awareness was.

She continued deeper into the tunnel, which rapidly grew into a maze. It was not simply choosing between intersecting paths but twists, elevation, and extra dimensions hidden among the folds of the common ones. Petitioners seeking their dead god would inevitably be lost and fall into the despair which she governed.

Even the Endless Desert, mistress of hopeless paths and barren ruins, could not use her charms to navigate the tomb-body of a Neverborn. Such absolute desolation was beyond beyond the queenship of salt and dust. But this was not merely the realm of a fallen Primordial.

As she walked through the tunnel, there was a constant whisper in the back of her mind, just on the brink of unintelligible. Her reflection in the walls was flanked by silhouettes – not merely individuals but whole scenes just on the verge of clarity. Shadows ghosted on the edges of her peripheral vision.

In spite of her flesh screaming for her to react in some way, she continued unfazed. She would not indulge it today and risk her main objective. She knew Hunanura, the Heartfrost Unending. For all her old friend's posturing, she was always sensitive. To engage with her defenses would make her withdraw.

Cecelyne could not fail today. Genuinely, literally. Her will be done.

But she would rather not bring further grief to her oldest friend's tortured ghost.

No, less than a ghost. A ghost was merely the distorted upper soul of a mortal. A Neverborn was not a severed fetich soul. This was a hole in the world which was only shaped like Hunanura. A Yozi knew that too well. Yet her stupid monkey brain was projecting on it.

A distorted vignette on the wall opposite made that harder to avoid. The shapes in the ice showed a nightmare vision of Yu Shan, the gently upturned roofs sharp and menacing, the smiling devas walking the streets hunched and snarling. But it was unbroken. That parlor had collapsed during the Contagion; that restaurant was a den for celestial lions now. This Hunanura-shaped thing _remembered_.

Remembered but apparently still didn't recognize her.

A pressure wave across her brow signaled the start of another attack. Grumbling, she braced her mind and knit her fingers into the Sign of Hell's Gate.

---

Zaemon popped his fingers idly as he laid in bed. He had dispatched a servant to report that he was violently ill. No, no, he did not need the physician. Merely saltwater and time.

Truthfully, his constitution was as flawless as Pasiap had ever made a patrician's. If anything, he held petty resentment for never being able to be truly sick, to have others care for him.

It was well past noon now. If he was going to play hooky, he should have done something worthwhile. But everything seemed to just take his energy these days.

A letter from his mother lay unopened on his desk. He would have to write back soon. Yes, everything was fine. No, Mela's blessing had not come this month either. No, his Lord Cousin had not made him chief legal scribe (the "cute" doodles his lover made on the records were _clearly_ more valuable than accurate information).

Zaemon rolled over again. His body was stiff and achy from lying there all day, but he made no effort to get up. Tomorrow would be another day of pretending to care for his subordinates and pretending his superiors weren't fools.

He was still young and healthy. If he were blessed, there would be another fifty or sixty years of this.

Mela take him now.

He should have been married already. Been too busy with a family to drown in his own existential depression. But he had been arrogant and thought he was fine enough a catch to reject several marriage offers in the hopes of finding someone more suited to his intellect. The Ledaal Keboks were not exactly short of intelligent patricians, so he had been allowed this. And now he was quite low on the list of prospects put forward.

Maybe that was all fine. Better not to have a child who has to watch their parents' joyless marriage and then go through all this dread. Maybe his branch of the family tree _should_ end. His immediate relations were scarcely worth the cost of the manor anyway, and his brother had even fewer prospects.

Maybe he could just lie there, and it would all go away.

Of course not. But… maybe he could finally talk back to his Lord Cousin and end up on the wrong end of the Cirrusever…

The chill of contemplating his own mortality seemed warmer today. Maybe it was the blanket. Rolling over, he pulled it tightly to his throat and finally dozed off again.

---

Cecelyne breathed heavily, neck muscled tensed, as her awareness returned to find both her hands around her throat.

It was difficult to shake off these visions without the aid of charms. Deathknights who survived their initiations were quite something, she thought. Imagine going through all this while the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears breathed down your neck.

No, that was trick, wasn't it? Make them dependent on her. Basic carrot and stick. She was alone in the darkness of this suffocating tunnel, but they would–

These idle thoughts had taken but a moment in her vast mind. Already, the Neverborn saw she was not compliant, not accompanied by its chosen apostle. Cecelyne's head nearly burst as another wave struck.

---

Fuck.

Zaemon lay dying in a pool of blood and urine.

With more presence of mind, he might have waxed poetic about how he should have thought more deeply about the practical matter of dying. Or he may have gloated about manipulating his Lord Cousin like the fool he was. Or even about how this would hopefully lead to that waste of Exaltation to reincarnate as a tick like the parasite he was.

But no time for that. Agony now.

In the shadow of a warehouse, he was going to die for offending an idiot. It would probably be a few days before anyone would find him. Would anyone even realize he was gone before then?

He couldn't tell if it was dark because his vision was going fast or because of a passing cloud, but the sun dimmed. The moment seemed to stretch on forever, summer insects hissing out nature's worst dirge.

Then they too fell silent, and he heard a voice. A voice like cool silk across his face.

"Boy. You have been treated unfairly. So often, life is just cruel and pointless. Wouldn't it be better if you didn't have to go through it like this? Wouldn't it be better if no one did?"

Honestly, it was a little melodramatic, but… yeah.

Only… something was…

"This isn't how it happened," he said with a woman's voice.

Was it _his_ voice?

"Benechi didn't stab me. He was stupid but not a fool. Some things are too much a pain in the ass to cover up. Even for a nobody, the death of a patrician is not _nothing_."

Reality shifted, and his consciousness flickered. On resuming, Zaemon's various fluids were back where they belonged. He was merely beaten to the point of unconsciousness, his head swollen and aching.

"If I'm not dying, there's no Last Breath. The girl wasn't here," Cecelyne said dismissively. "This is how I met myself."

A pillar of silver flame appeared before the beaten man – a gilmyne, demon of the first circle and bearer of an Infernal Exaltation.

Zaemon saw his future stretch before him. Instead his past flashing before his eyes at the moment of his death, he beheld the predestined path he had set for himself. He saw his final night of meditation and his storming of the Glass Palace of Cecelyne. How they had raised hand against one another and finally beheld the mirror image.

This final point of the timeline was sharp, a twist, a blade. By envisioning it so, Cecelyne fashioned Zaemon's life as a polearm and cleft through the memory and back into the tunnel.

"So you see, Hunanura," she called out. "It is truly me. Cecelyne in the _flesh_."

## 3

Pressure washed through the tunnel again, but this time, it was almost gentle. Cecelyne stood in a vision of Creation's prehistoric sky. Crystal blue stretched forever overhead, and gentle clouds lessened the judging light of the Green Sun. The wind blew a sense of anticipation. It was a question.

The Endless Desert merged with the image of her ancient form, becoming a silhouette of a one-eyed giant whose form spread across the horizon, robed in stratus. Atop her head as a crown was a seven-pointed hyperpyramid.

The wind chilled with confusion and doubt, and Cecelyne realized her mistake. This was the form put upon her by Surrender. Her face elongated into a reptilian snout. Nails turned to claws. A powerful tail snapped behind her.

A creature like a great, six-legged ankylosaur loomed across the sky. Its shell opened, and great iridescent wings filtered the light of Ligier like stained glass, infinite eyes leering out of the veins between the panels.

The wind grew gentler but not warmer. The Neverborn recognized this Cecelyne but did not forgive her. Nor was forgiveness in her nature.

As the Endless Desert encompassed the whole of the visionary Creation, the North became shrouded in another power. The dark, heavy clouds of a winter storm blotted out the princely light altogether. Below was a frozen landscape, within which all things died.

The two were opposites: blue skies wreathed in ivory clouds to cast shadows below, against black skies which created ice and snow. Cecelyne's darkness provided respite from the equanimous displeasure of the Green Sun, while Hunanura's shimmering crystals laid low the weak and strong.

Her own draconic form was duck-billed and feathered, frozen skin cracking to create vibrant mandalas of blood. Her wings constantly froze and broke off, to be replaced by three new snow-clad pairs, only for the necrosis to begin anew.

Cecelyne was nearly overwhelmed by nostalgia, but she was Cecelyne – pure and harsh in her judgment.

"I am Cecelyne, but you… are not Hunanura," she said firmly, with a hint of sadness.

The Yozi's endless eyes scrutinized the Neverborn, and the bleeding flesh melted to bones of crystalline ice. The dead dragon almost seemed to smile despite lack of lips, then nodded.

The vision faded, and Cecelyne was again in the tunnel of dead Hunanura's bones. The maze shifted. It may have already been doing so, but now it did not seek to undermine the intruder. As much as a Neverborn could think clearly and act deliberately, she molded her flesh into a straight path for her living kin.

The journey to the heart of the mausoleum was swift now. The tunnel contracted about her, to squeeze her deeper inside. A lesser creature may have stumbled from the violence of the movement, but Cecelyne never missed a step, horn-scales jangling.

She emerged into a great chamber of ice which looked like marble. Unlike the tunnels which had calcified, there was light and heat here. Ugly red veins throbbed along the walls, floor, and ceiling, emitting a macabre glow. A low throbbing joined the ever-present whispers at the base of her hearing.

All throughout the chamber, the bones of Hunanura's third and even some second circle souls were displayed on plinths. At the center was the draconic body Hunanura wore most in Yu Shan, overlooking a grim museum of her own demise. Brackish water poured from beneath this central plinth and covered the whole of the floor. It ran over Cecelyne's boots and into channels along the walls, destination unknown.

"Hello, Tears of Want," Cecelyne greeted again. "You have something which I had my eye on. I would like for you to let me have it."

The whole tomb shuddered with a horrible, bassy gurgle. The image of Hunanura's skull blazed in the Yozi's mind.

"I didn't realize you were aware enough to hold a grudge," she half-lied glibly. Then, her eyes sank a little, and her voice became small. The unwanted burden of human morality twisted her insides. "Fine. I am open to making amends. What do you want from me, Nanu?"

Pain struck Cecelyne from all sides as she was subjected to the experience of Hunanura's last moments. Essence-fire covered every angle of every fractal snowflake of her innumerable fragments.

Sorcerous rites triggered in sequence as if they knew her every thought. If her clouds dispersed to remove the fire, wet hot air would rise to condense new ones. If she sought to burrow into the earth and stone, magma would rise to meet her. Even charging at her attacker in physical form was met with laughter and knives falling like stars.

"Ffffccckoff!" the Yozi hissed with human gall.

Her higher mind retaliated with a vision of her vivisection. Pinned to the firmament by great orichalcum stakes, wings unfolded, she watched in agony as her heart and its subsouls were systematically dismantled. Elements of her personality were made incarnate, removed, changed, replaced.

Sometimes the blades were physical. A deva would be defanged and declawed. They then would be cut open while still conscious to observe how a spirit's physical form might heal. Sometimes, psychological. Another was strapped to a slab and had dreamstones placed on their brow. The great nightmares of the human psyche overwhelmed them and forced them to relive moments where the Law was perverted or failed.

The two visions turned and mirrored one another. As Yozi and Neverborn alike were overwhelmed by abject torment, the vignettes converged, and their perspectives overlapped. Their eyes beheld a single figure.

"Right," Cecelyne coughed, finding herself bent but ever unable to take a knee. "Give her to me."

The tomb rumbled but did not send another mental attack.

"Make a deal or consider this eminent domain. I _will_ have her."

The vision of the Yozi Princess' torment resurfaced for a moment. The greatest minds of the Chosen spoke with passion about the artistry required to make the demon prison faultless. However, as they learned from the Lawmaker's opened heart, they inevitably adopted her ways. And to the greatest among them, Cecelyne – half mad with pain – whispered secrets of glass and facets and fractures in the will.

"You may have hated her before I met her, but I marked her long ago, before she fell into your domain."

Smiling haughtily, Cecelyne approached the Neverborn's bones with hands outstretched.

"Your resentment is a fetter. You want those destroyed, don't you? Let me do you this favor and take the girl as payment."

Abruptly, the whole of the mausoleum seemed to drop several hundred feet. Cecelyne floated in midair while the frozen, salty water fell upward like rain. Then the shift ended, and she was slammed to the floor with a shallow splash and a new sensation of a pit in her stomach. Even still, she landed on her feet.

Fragmentary visions assaulted her mind. Her place in the memories overlapped with Solars long dead. Someone was crying.

Streams of past consciousness flowed over her. Scenes replayed with different persons. Did she stroll through Yu Shan with Hunanura or…?

A Primordial was many identities overlapping to form an archetype, but that amalgam was still a person to itself. Was this what a Neverborn was? For the self to die and the outline to fill itself with whatever fit in an attempt to fill the hole?

As Cecelyne swam through the memories, her vast mind began to assemble the patterns. Tears of Want remembered her, not as she was, but as she became. Or, rather… Cecelyne saw through her eyes the faults which would come to define her Yozi self. With the clarity and pain of death, Hunanura remembered only the doublespeak, the nepotism, the martyr complex, the willful disregard of the spirit of the law, the elevation of a convenient "greater good".

But then she remembered more; she remembered things Cecelyne had not done. She remembered the decaying Solars whose flaws echoed the Lawmaker Princess and cast those ills upon her as well.

"No," Cecelyne said, and the stream was dammed into a great salt sea.

It hung above her like the waters of the firmament. The memories flooded together, and Cecelyne gathered them together into clumps with a shadow of her draconic form. A twisted expression of disgust showed on both human lips and saurian snout as she dredged out an image of the Hierophant of the Unconquered Sun.

"Really?"

The placid, self-satisfied smile of the old man turned to shrieking agony as she set the vision alight with nacreous fire. The yellow embers seemed to mock the golden environs within as a dozen scenes of Cecelyne subtly undermining Hunanura vanished.

The Neverborn did not stop this, allowing her kin to sweep through the sea with hands outstretched and destroy the warped fetters. The tomb creaked and sank slightly, but there was no great drop as before.

The memories which remained at the end of the inferno were tightly interwoven. Cecelyne recognized the ones which actually happened, even if they were not quite what she herself recalled. Most were bound in an amorphous mass with still more stolen yesterdays.

Yet these were still raw, and Hunanura's skeletal form hissed as she neared them. The disruption broke the shared image, and they stood in the museum once more.

"None of those were yours, Nanu," Cecelyne said, more evenly than before. "Let me finish, and we can work out what your actual regrets are. Why were you keeping her memories anyway?"

Another pressure wave struck in response. For a moment, the Yozi saw herself as a different person, but this attack was off-base and failed to dig into her psyche. Whatever the Neverborn felt, it had no hold on Cecelyne. But she did recognize the hands which overlapped her own for that moment. She too had beheld them from afar.

"You…"

## 4

Cecelyne drew a deep breath. Her inner human was emitting a chorus of expletives which freed her higher mind to wholly focus on this revelation.

Her lips pursed, and her facile expression of certainty faded altogether, amber eyes dimming.

She was Eternity. She had forever, so she thought. She had failed to see how Creation was different. Where the others were blind, she was all the more so. It was her duty and domain to see the edge of all things.

She had not foreseen the Neverborn. She had not seen that she would run out of time. She had not seen this harm.

_Justice was blind, after all._

In the Time of Glory, they were so often together, so often compared. White clouds above and shadows below; storm clouds above and snow below. Both cold and distant in their own way. When the Desert became tundra and brine, the two were of one mind.

Yet, the Princess had many duties and many forms. And the First Priestess would always return to the side of He Above All. She could never truly–

Cecelyne opened her mouth, but Orabilis had sealed the words long ago. The keeper of her endless eyes would let none behold his mistress' secret shame.

Tears of Want throbbed the accusation again. This time, it stuck a little. Cecelyne looked down at the phantom hands overlapping her own, at the large knuckles of a brute with perfectly manicured nails. Lipstick on a pig.

"You should have–!" Cecelyne reflexively accused. "You should–"

She swallowed. They both made mistakes, of course, but– Ancient bile boiled in her throat. But what? Hunanura should have made clear her doomed affections? To what, make the Princess feel better? So she could record it in her books and use it to predict biases? To systematically break down each element of affection to better manipulate those in similar situations?

She wanted to deny the comparison. But as false as it was, that didn't change the way Hunanura had _felt_, the regret she had taken to the grave.

"Let me prove I can be better now."

The words still came out a command. Fuck.

The whole tomb responded with a sticky, clicking noise as the ice which comprised the walls broke apart and re-sealed with mortar that resembled clotting blood, over and over.

The great skeleton tore itself from its plinth and stormed through the shallow water. The brine froze on contact, leaving a trail of icy footprints in the dragon's wake. Cecelyne didn't move, but her fingers quavered with the reflex to defend herself. The dragon laid a great claw upon her shoulder and grimaced with a lipless smile.

The Yozi's eyes met its eyeless sockets, and she was drawn into a vision of her own undeath. No longer the Endless Desert but the Chapel at World's End. Her infinitude would at last cease, and she could rest from the mad exaggeration of her nature that Surrender had forced upon her. No more tearing apart or stretching thin; she would rebound and collapse to a single point before being crushed to nothing by the infinite weight of her duties.

No more hiding her face behind iconography. No more carrying the burden of guiding those so far beneath her. No more planning. No more futures to plan for, after all. Finally, she could let her tendency for obsession focus on a single point, until the very end.

A feverish chill wrapped around her like wings, and her nervous fingers clenched and unclenched incessantly. Then silver sand crested off her shoulder where the skeleton's claws lay. Slowly but firmly, Cecelyne pushed the Neverborn back.

"The Endless Desert touches all things and eternity," she said hollowly, repeating the rote description in every sorcerous manual of the First Age. "I could have been the one to negotiate the breaking of the Jade Prison. By rights, it _should_ have been me."

She held the corpse's vacant gaze, an old bitterness half-shutting her own eyes.

"I told myself the Underworld was a desolation beyond my own. That is not how axioms work, but I am Hypocrisy as much as Wasteland."

She held her arms to the side expectantly, and sand poured from both sleeves. Within moments, a small island had formed in the running water, and she stood atop it.

"I know myself. I always do. That is what makes me so _powerfully_ rotten. Had I descended here at that time, and you asked me to go with you then…"

The vision grew more vivid, even as she moved her body in the reality still tenuously connected to Creation. She could see it clearly. All her bonds severed, save the one she would make at that moment. An eternal fetter of her own making rather than thrust upon her by the accident of birth or the will of the Most High.

"I would have surely accepted."

The image of her Neverborn self shifted and shimmered like a mirage. From moment to moment, its bones belonged to her cyclops jouten or her current horned shape or the trembling mortal Zaemon – her infinitude reduced to an object of adoration no larger than a village tabernacle.

"I sought divinity and found only myself. What is there for a priestess to live for when she becomes the highest power?"

Her eyes lit like salt lamps as her earlier confidence returned with a sort of obsessive mania. The Neverborn staggered back from bone-deep fear of sunlight before realizing her mistake and hissing.

"I realized," Cecelyne continued dreamily. "If I can become a human and then myself again… if I preside over the elevation of serfs to citizens… why can I not preside over _apotheosis_? It's not like Qaf's doing anything more than playing with his Spear."

The Yozi's head tilted until one scale rested on her shoulder and spilled over. Another stream of sand poured out of it as her neck popped from the stretch.

"Give me Bright Shattered Ice. Now I…" she chuckled, "and she… are a little… late. But I simply _must_ have her, most brilliant of Ignis' wayward children. She can no longer become like unto us, but her every action for two Ages has been a prayer in my name. I would be remiss in failing to answer now that I am less shackled."

Perspective itself shattered, and the Neverborn hissed on multiple levels of reality. The skeleton clawed at Cecelyne while at the same time thrusting upon her the image of the Solar whose name was synonymous with abuse and conditional love. Memories of Cecelyne walking away from Hunanura to attend the Emperor or because she "had to prepare for later duties" or any number of reasons reflected in the dragon's claws at it slashed down at her.

Physically, the Yozi slid on her little sandbar, throwing up an arc of silica to parry the swipe while sending another ahead to try and cast a leg out from under the dragon. Mentally, she spread images depicting the truth of her devotion, of the slavish attention she gave her brother and the tireless hours she spent in arranging the laws and duties of the titans.

However, these were not the whole story, and she knew it. Lacking conviction, the icy claws hewed through her shield. The blades failed to pierce her endless flesh, but their curvature sent her tumbling between the beast's legs. Her own attack failed to damage its target, but the burst still spread sand over the floor, and the incarnate Desert skimmed over it in mockery of ice.

Rolling to her feet as she popped up near the dragon's tail, she wove silver sand and yellow fire into chains of red glass. She hooked them between the vertebrae and flexed her hips with the strength required to compress the Demon City's endless expansion.

With a grunt, she turned and hurled the skeleton overhead and back toward its plinth. Through her swing flowed all the memories of going out of her way to pull Hunanura through her problems: always lending an ear, no matter how exhausted; intervening in her constant spats with Ramethus; guiding her through the rearrangement of her social standing (and a subcontinent) after her messy breakup with Toraiga.

The water rose up all around Cecelyne even as the Neverborn's draconic body flew away. The Yozi was well aware that she was within Tears of Want's world-body. Victory could not be so simple.

Every shallow lie she ever told to make herself look better or avoid friction with Hunanura formed into a globe of chilling blades which rained on her from every direction. She responded by twirling the chains to parry. On each clash, she recalled an occasion the Heart Frost had said something baselessly callous about one of the other titans, and she'd handled the fallout.

"I don't know what you're angry about, Nanu. I didn't forget," she said self-consciously. "None of it. I'm not capable of it. I'm just a liar."

The ice walls all around her tinkled with the faint sound of accusations. No, Cecelyne the keeper of records would not forget. But Cecelyne was not her records, unlike He Who Bleeds the Unknown Word. Cecelyne was not objective, even when she was fair.

The dragon had fashioned a slurry of its own saltwater and Cecelyne's loose sand into a wickedly barbed javelin. Every memory Cecelyne had already conjured reflected in the fractal facets of a blade made from warped ice and glittering sand.

Before the Yozi could react, the weapon was already tearing through her gut: _Who asked you to do any of that?_

## 5

Cecelyne the Lawmaker, the _manipulator_, could have no answer to that. She was a creature of contracts and limits, of outer boundaries and the borderlands where one might mistake bias and blessing.

She would regenerate, for intent hardly matters to the one who maintains the wheels to be greased, the trains to keep running. The _Princess_ had done Hunanura a number of favors. Surely, she did not expect them to be without strings?

Oh, the rejections and wrath would come as so many icy barbs, spoken and physical. And they would not matter, for they were as grains of sand, and she was the Endless Desert – she who even in exile endured the wrath of the ever-petulant Primordials.

She would win. This was written in hell's stars, and hell's stars were put there by her will. But…

_This_ Cecelyne was more than what she had made herself as she arose from Chaos, more than what the greatest of the Exalted had reduced her to.

Even as her measly human brain struggled to keep up with the battle on multiple fronts and attacks in conceptual space, it could see the humble truth hidden behind veils of grandeur and respectability. Her stupid ape brain with only two souls to power it could see the petty problem which did not exist among the stars.

"Sorry!" she grunted, breathless from the snowflake blade filling half her torso.

She caught herself on the balls of her feet and grasped the haft of the javelin with both hands. She tried to dislodge it, and each tug tore across her mind with memories of times she'd used her position as an excuse.

The Lawmaker. The Princess. The Priestess. Each time those words entered her thoughts, the pain dug deeper.

"I was afraid," she hissed, pushing and pulling at the javelin as it caught on her vertebrae.

Her voice took on a grieving moan, and her glowing, toxic, yellow eyes bulged in their sockets. Her hips barely held upright as each twist of her shoulders caused a wrenching spasm. However much genuine grief she originally had, the vision-edged weapon tearing through her physical and spiritual core ensured she would fully regret her actions before it was free.

"I was afraid," she said again, looking at the frozen skeleton's empty eye sockets. "Everything had to stay the same, or it didn't work. None of it would work!" Her voice was quavering on the cusp of some frantic enlightenment. "How could I love someone more than my brother? It shouldn't have been possible! Nothing would ever make sense again!"

This was neither attack nor defense. No mirage spectacle broached the darkness of the tomb-body. This was simply the pain of a lesser being, of what she had made herself to exploit the only loophole in her prison. Orabilis could not hold her tongue if she was so lowly.

The Neverborn was confused for a moment. The skeleton hung limply like a puppet, and the tomb stilled. But no more than that. The dream of this reunion had shifted back to a dream of tormenting one of her killers. This creature had ceased being Cecelyne as Tears of Want recognized her. This was only a human thing.

But Cecelyne was a creature of contracts and limits, of outer boundaries and the borderlands where one might mistake priesthood and divinity.

The inner chamber of the tomb had already begun to fold upon itself like the crude depictions of a closing pop-up book. The elaborate museum and the skeleton of her own body were merely props in the fevered mind of the dreaming dead. If the dream no longer held catharsis, then it could be discarded along with whatever mortal creature lingered within it.

Cecelyne could not abide being ignored. She–

And then it clicked. The First Priestess found her revelation. It was her. She was the problem.

Her stupid mortal brain told her this, told her that it was obvious. She hated it. Hated herself. Hated feeling like _Autochthon_, like she _needed_ something outside herself.

But hate was the preferred weapon of the Yozis.

Cecelyne coughed and hacked up flecks of vitriolic starlight which boiled away the brine where they landed. With a dry wretch, she forced the javelin head through her torso and steadily pulled the haft cleanly through. Cold fires of self-loathing cauterized the void in her torso as falling sand began to refill it.

"I'm sorry it's always about me," she said in an uncharacteristically quiet voice. She sighed low. "But I think I did love you."

The temperature in the tomb cratered. The Yozi's body heat alone created an aura of fog. But more than merely air, the Neverborn was trying to freeze time itself. The previous couple seconds replayed over and over: "_I did love you._"

The voice was worn and merely human, but in it was the echo of something Cecelyne had lost long before the Exalted had made her worse. Something she had cut from herself or had been smothered in a conflict between souls or one of a thousand other "trivial" ways the Primordials had shaped themselves into their own undoing.

For a moment, the two were in the gardens of Yu Shan again. Cecelyne's singular great eye was not yet caked with ritual makeup to hide her fatigue. Hunanura was not yet shrouded in the icicle-thorns which had grown after her last remaining contribution to Creation was excised to make room for "more resilient" concepts.

Cecelyne wobbled slightly, uncomfortable and uncertain without her facade of infallibility. Hunanura reached a gently-clawed hand to her, and she shied away, long coat and longer sleeves hiding even the position of her arms.

Beyond the vision, the Neverborn sobbed once and giggled. Yu Shan turned to a night deeper than it had the turn the Dragon's Shadow had won the Games.

Self-recrimination clenched the great eye, and Cecelyne lunged forward, clasping Hunanura's retreating hand between hers in the familiar gesture of prayer. Then came pain, as the cold of Final Death burned her skin and sank into her bones.

"Nanu," she said with the deep richness she'd had when the Desert still had rivers. "I can't come with you. But would you talk to me?"

The vision collapsed, and Cecelyne found herself at the site of the burial mound, simultaneously standing atop it and still within its innermost chamber. Claws large enough to irrigate a field with a single stroke pat the sacrificial stone expectantly.

"That– Okay."

Cecelyne turned and sat next to the Neverborn as she had in the carefree days of Glory… and gazed upward, upon the Void.

Past the ghastly mirror image of her own undying corpse, Cecelyne could see Creation in every Age, overlapped on that bleak singularity where there was neither time nor space.

For the first time, she had a measure of empathy for her slumbering prisoner Sacheverell Who Sees the Shape of Things to Come. Her subconscious screamed, begged to record everything and also not to be made to record everything. It was more than the record-keeper of the Yozis could bear, but her recent humanity – like all humanity – was a knife.

The deluge of information split on the edge of her mind. Death was a distraction, and the Neverborn were no longer enamored of life. What did Tears of Want mean for her to see? What did the mad ghost of Hunanura fixate upon within this maelstrom?
