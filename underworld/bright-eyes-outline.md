## Conflict

### Outline

#### Invitation to Confession

- Kindly old man routine. "Come in, dear."
    - Lover looks "dreadful", with a lifelike blush and a light in her eyes.
    - She has an unusual collar.
- The Neverborn had declared her lost, but their messaging remains incoherent.
    - Bishop worried it was "that patricidal Tepet woman again".
    - Deathlords are being "lost" (unclear how many destroyed/redeemed).
- Lover indulges Bishop's vanity by asking what particular cruelties in life inspired his theology.
    - Bishop deflects, saying all Deathlords know but won't say.
- Lover admits her envy of Salina was her breaking point.
    - Had everything her past self ever wanted.
    - No War trauma.
    - Not required to be a terrible person to maintain her identity.
    - Equal talent but still had passion; not hardened and intractable.
- Bishop urges her not to reflect on life, lest she incur the wrath of the Neverborn.
    - Lover agrees but says she has more to say – will he take Confession?
    - Bishop is fully erect.
- Confessional resembles the tombs of the Neverborn.
    - Joke about comfort level of kneeling.
- Lover recites the whole credo.
    - It's only been 40 days since her last confession.
    - This surprises Bishop, but he keeps kayfabe.
- Lover admits that she's thinking more about herself these days.
    - Something has finally stirred her up.
    - She can't be the Lover anymore.
- Bishop mentions how "dearly departed" Prince had many identities.
- Lover clarifies that she's out. The Neverborn were direct.
- Bishop speaks over her, soothing and certain.
    - All things will come to Oblivion in time.
    - No one is beyond redemption.
    - They pray together, but Lover's prayer is… wrong.
- Lover lets the veil drop, revealing her living essence.
- Bishop is wroth. This is the ultimate blasphemy. Resurrection is a horror destroyed in the Primordial War.
- Lover offers him a hand through the screen.
    - People like them don't get third chances.
- Bishop reaches out and smiles.
- He takes her hand, but his grip roils with the Void.
- Lover smiles. Her body emits blue-silver flames which stretch the void to infinity.

#### Initial Exchange

- Bishop comments that it's been a while since they performed hand-binding practice.
- Bishop tries to push through, then Lover, back and forth.
- Their strikes start to destroy the confessional, previewing their powers.
- Lover suggests they take the battle outside.
    - Avoid damaging the study and putting the Tome of Endless Night at risk.
    - Framed as exhibitionism.
- Bishop accepts and offers her opportunity to leave while he sets things in order.

**Villain Song Seduction**

- It's noon, but Bishop has blotted out the sun to create a negative light.
- Lover eclipses the false sun, unfurling her wings of burning night.
    - Azure aurora and starlit icicles.
- A more natural night falls.
- She looks over the warring death cults, who look up at her as an omen.
- There's no distinction between the living and the dead, and all are trapped in a necromantic upscale of the House Arrest arcanoi, trapping them in the Underworld.
- She belts out the first verse of her song before the Bishop can make a suitably dramatic entrance with necromancy.
- When she delivers the chorus, the backup singers are non-Abyssal Exalts she's enslaved.
    - Represent the different facets of life.
- The cults are confused, being given a very compelling argument that death is something you give your enemies rather than an aspiration.
- Bishop emerges in all his glory.
- Seeing that the cults are caught up in shaping combat, he starts a second verse.
- Lover throws a star into his throat like a dagger.
- Bishop is livid and rings a chime which breaks the spell.
    - It wasn't a compulsion; Lover just broke the brainwashing and is a charisma monster.
    - Their wills are weakened, but they can't be re-brainwashed as a result.
    - Bishop mistakes the mentioned "Azure Mother" for an identity of the Lover's.
    - "Why _this_ imago? A mother – you? – who was always so terrified of the concept? Had a change of heart after this time, or are you planning on asking me to mask the abortifacents a second time?"
- "I see you've found wings again. Another poor soul for you to use until you tire, like that chained beast you called a husband."

#### Dance-Off, Bro

- Bishop never expected to be cornered like this. He could personally run, but he can't accept that he would lose the _hearts_ of his cults, that his theology was not more compelling than cheap empathy.
- Bishop's own Exalts are mostly away. His favorite is on guard, but she's a true believer and wants to die for him in glorious combat.
- Bishop frames the events as a test. The Lover is affecting the role of a devil to the faith. She would be struck down by the Neverborn if she truly turned.
- The cults and "guests" should watch their exhibition.
- A fight on the scale that the cults can witness occurs.
- Lots of lasers and flashy effects.
- Bishop principally relies on Abyssal effects.
    - Sid effects are worse or harder to use.
    - Passes damage to cultists but sometimes fails because Lover converted the only valid targets.
    - Staff can turn into a hellbat automaton.
- Lover uses agnostic effects with a constellation/ice theme.
    - Meteor hammer made from her old necklace on an adamant chain.
    - Extra "glitter" in her attacks which seems to be ice or snow but is actually sand.
- Specific exchanges:
    - Bishop sees the meteor hammer and demands to know why she has the knucklebones of Whose Whispers Chain again.
    - Bishop catches the hammer on his crook, which turns into a bat and tries to steal it. Lover instead swings it around like a kite before letting a Solar pawn destroy it.
- Rather than trying to win, each combatant tries to lead the dance, to win over the audience.
- Lover is an excellent dancer, and Bishop is soundly beaten despite being the better fighter.

#### Dimensional Reprise

- Bishop is livid. He doesn't know what "losing" would actually mean, but he's not about to be cuckolded of his own flock by the Sexlord.
- Decides his cult is better off soul-destroyed rather than seduced.
- Tries to wipe them all out but blocked by Solar AoE perfect parry.
- Pulls her into the Underworld where he has more control and her minions can't quickly follow.
- Lover escapes the hold and rises with a massive silver pillar behind her.
- Bishop is horrified to see the Endless Desert pouring into the Underworld.
- "And a band of demons joined in, and it sounded something like this..."
    - Bishop calls nephwracks and hekatonkhires up from the Labyrinth.
    - Demons of Cecelyne rush the field.
    - Infinite numbers of horrid desert creatures.
    - Three never-before-seen Laments take the hekatons.
    - Laments finally clarify what's happened to Lover by calling her "sister".
- Bishop tries to sanction the demons with the all-ending authority of the Neverborn but is countered with mass perfect parry "That's illegal!"
- Environment-bending effects between the Deathlords, Bishop moliating the Underworld vs Lover shaping Cecelyne.
- Bishop takes his war-form and compels Lover to reveal hers as well.
    - Bishop is SMT Mara.
    - Lover is now Helcaraxe, the Desert of Grinding Ice, daughter of the Endless Desert.
    - Helcaraxe is a frankenstein with her tattered human spirit stitched into the body of a hollow Lament.
    - Her main body is a sphinx/manticore/lamassu. Lion body, eagle wings, scorpion tail and armor.
- As an Ex-Endings-Sid, Bishop is very good at cutting threads.
    - Physically attacks the healing tissue.
    - Socially attacks the new Intimacies.
- Helcaraxe understands pain and wounds more than most.
    - Cauterizes her wounds, blistering the dissimilar flesh together.
    - "Mother thinks she's so clever, leaving the work unfinished as if I could simply retract my decision."
- Cara's form is much better suited for monster fights.
- Cara slowly tears Bishop to shreds.
- Bishop grows increasingly ecstatic as he nears final dissolution.
- Bishop prepares himself to enter BOSS.
- Cara keeps exhausting him instead.
- Bishop finally does a "strike me down".
- Lover uses a hellish version of the House Arrest arcanoi.
- Bishop panics since he can't hear the Whispers anymore.
- Bishop tries to take his own life, either to activate BOSS or to at least joint the Void.
- Cara catches him and starts pushing him down into the sand.
- Cara's flame begins to glass over the sand, binding him up to his neck.
- "Don't worry. There's always an ending."

### Themes

- The Void vs the Endless Desert. (Snow vs Sand.)
