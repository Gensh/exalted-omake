# Nothing Really Matters

For all the kindliness he affected, the Bishop of the Chalcedony Thurible rarely received guests. Imagine his delight when his goodly neighbor wrote to ask if she might visit to consult on matters of the spirit.

A plot, of course. The woman was incorrigible. Yet, she overestimated herself as always. This was an avenue for enlightenment, for communion between fellow apostles of Oblivion when their numbers steadily waned.

And, perhaps, if he were honest with himself, a pleasant diversion with… was she a _friend_, all those years ago? Frequent co-conspirator? No matter, the bonds of life should be as nothing.

Of course, he would have to… insist that she veil herself. Oh, to show his flock the terror of two Deathlords walking in stride would be a marvelous spectacle of inevitability. Yet, if they were to lay eyes upon the one who embodied the beauty of Death, they might develop needless fetters.

He manifested his ever-shifting manse, the Hidden Tabernacle, in its easternmost shadowland as a show of grace. It truly made no difference, but performative gestures grease the wheels of ego – and what else is a ghost?

The manse squatted in the snowdrifts of the valley for a week like an ugly, gilded gargoyle. Blearying incense smoke poured from holes in the decrepit structure like bile from a mouth with too many corners. The discordant dirge of an outsized organ howled through the weary stone walls and the chips in the ancient gold leaf.

The aboveground structure, in its petite size and unmaintained state, seemed as if an ancient local shrine which had fallen into disfavor but had yet avoided looting. However, that could never be. Its architecture and its very stone were altogether foreign. More, it could never be mistaken for abandoned.

On the first night, the flocks had come. They raised the banners of their faith and made obeisance to the Shining One. They would prove their righteousness and orthodoxy over the heretics all around. They would die righteous and true deaths, and the few who lived would come to pray at His side until their victorious but unneeded flesh fell away.

And so they did. On the eighth day, those condemned to live welcomed yet more to the cause. They raised their prayers to the sky once more and feasted their last before joining battle as their predecessors did.

Those who had fallen yet who did not abandon faith fought alongside their living counterparts, so that they might see the inner chambers of the Tabernacle together. A few days more, and there was no difference between life and death: all was prayer and battle and haggard eyes which glinted with the Shining One's cold light.

It was on the thirteenth day, as the second sectarian purge was reaching its height that a palanquin appeared over the rim of the valley. The lonely guard of the temple's only door blew a sad trumpet which opened the gate early.

The wretched combatants thought perhaps they would receive early reward or due punishment for their failure to slay the heretics swiftly. All knees collapsed in the bloodstained snow, all brows pressed into the cold and iron as the Shining One emerged in a visceral, gilded haze which turned the throat to fluid and caused the mind to wash away.

The palanquin opposite was borne aloft by four who were beautiful but yet lived. They were not Chosen of Death, but of lesser things and so creatures of pity. Their faces bore the look of Death, but there would ever be too much life in their spirits. This instinctive resistance to final peace was the curse of crueler gods.

Who then was this saintly figure, swathed in the deepest miasma of the Void, yet who kept such damned creatures leashed nearby?

The Bishop emerged into the gently-spiraling snow with a smile which could be mistaken for genuine. He was garbed lightly for the weather and for his ostensible position. His pitch-black cassock was clean but worn, and an umber stole marked with eye-watering sacred signs resembled a muffler.

"My dear!" he called out over the shocked zealots with a sweetness that hurt their hearts. "Come! It has been far too long, my child!"

He beckoned, but not to them. It was as if he had no awareness of them. As he strode across the slush thick with their lifeblood, it silently sizzled away so that his every footfall was upon barren earth.

"Let us be away from these dull sights and out of this poor excuse for Oblivion's chill."

As he spoke, the words eviscerated their spirits. They lived for him, sought death for him. So far below his notice, they finally _truly_ felt the Void he preached. A few living realized this and took their own lives before they forgot the feeling. Some of the dead hurled themselves into the bowels of the earth, as if that would lead to the promised land of the Labyrinth.

Slowly, the Bishop made his way to meet the palanquin halfway. The living things bowed – but not so far as the zealots. The Shining One was not their liege. He extended a hand to the edge of the curtain.

The hand that closed on his was flawless. The leg that emerged, concealed in skirt and boot as it was, was flawless. The whole which emerged, indiscernible within voluminous and a hooded veil, still possessed a wicked, tempting magnetism. Every piece of the attire was just _slightly_ off. Just a bit of ankle showed, just a glimpse of cheek. The few who dared raise their heads were instantly smitten.

The Bishop pretended not to notice. Later, of course. He couldn't let her corruption spread, but it would be rude to deal with such a trifle while she was present. He took her hand and guided her down from the palanquin and onto the path he had burned through the snow.

He rankled a little. This was not an attire he had seen before. Certainly, he had requested it, but he was disgusted to find that it possessed power over even _himself_. Not carnally – of course not – but it bore sacred signs much like his own, and he found himself unwittingly fascinated by the cipher.

_She Who Must Be Obeyed_, indeed. He was impressed as much as he was frustrated. A simple trick. But it worked.

"Such a lovely pattern," he said, a little further back in his throat than he'd have liked. "You _must_ tell me how you broke the ghosts to work with such precision. Oh, and it's all so very unique. I'm curious as to the– oh, do forgive an old man."

He continued smiling, his blind eyes staring at the impassive screen of her veil.

"I have had precious few opportunities to discuss such niceties since our brother so shamefully cast himself upon the Sun's mercy."

As convenient as it was to have a rival removed, he almost missed the Walker in Darkness. The rest were… lacking in fervor and theological rigor. This seeming change in the Lover was welcome. However insincere or short-lived, it was a chance to spread the Gospel of Oblivion. If he changed the way she conducted herself in the slightest, it would be a victory worthy of the diversion.

The Lover simply nodded in silence. Her expression could not be seen through the veil. It was some material he didn't immediately recognize. Active charms could certainly peer through, but why be so rude when she was considerate enough to refrain from speaking around his flock?

He wrapped a heavy arm around her shoulder and began to lead her inside. Silence was a blessing, but it was not for him today. As they walked, he made sure to keep speaking, to save her from temptation, of course.
