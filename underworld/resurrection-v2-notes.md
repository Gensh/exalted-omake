#### Identity progression

- Unknown original identity
    - Northerner
    - Still has resentment against the dragon kings
    - Always subtly envious of the dragon kings in spite of herself
    - Always focused more on achievements than cost
    - Participation in the Revolution based in need to make something of herself
    - Used every form of intellect to fight
        - Master sorceress
        - Summoning is limited to horrors banished beneath Creation
        - Armies of golems
        - Decent duelist; focus on exploiting the envirionment
    - Killed Hunanura Heartfrost Unending
        - Fight opened as a concerted attempt where she directed armies and was supported by her Circle
        - She underestimated Hunanura, and the armies were all lost
        - She intended to go down with the ship to let her Circle flee
        - She couldn't help but feel betrayed that they would actually leave her instead of having a heroic moment
        - Took her new name from Hunanura because she died inside anyway and was reborn as something colder
    - Hunanura was a monster of numbness
        - Incredible blunt physical defense
        - Could ignore social attacks almost flawlessly
        - No fear or other confounding feelings
    - A rare solo Primordial kill
        - BSI didn't use her intellect for plans but to pick apart social defenses
        - Crushed Hunanura under her own weight

        - "I wonder if you'll feel anything at all when you're the last one alive?"
- Bright Shattered Ice
    - Foremost scientist in Creation
    - Chair of too many projects to actually attend
    - Chair of the Cauldronists and major backer of their more sociopathic bullshit
    - Relied on her Lunar Mate for emotional support, but he got tired of it
    - Desus' on-again, off-again mistress and constantly emotionally devastated
    - Hated Salina for being nearly her equal but with everything she never had and no PTSD or abandonment issues
    - Unlike most Solars, never had children (even by experiment)
    - Looked up to by most of Creation for her seniority
    - Ran a sterile surveillance state
    - Constantly spied on her peers and seized their experiments
- The Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears
    - Combined with the fetich soul of Hunanura
    - "I want to be numb"
    - Dominated by ennui
    - Wanted to destroy Creation one soul at a time
    - Oblivion less a place and more a mindset
    - Loved giving her prisoners everything they desired, until they begged her to stop
    - If worst came to worst (or it was a slow Friday), she could just break them directly
    - Few Deathknights, focusing on independence and competence
    - Preferred to do everything herself (someone else might get it wrong)
- Helcaraxe
    - Re-transplanted into a soul of Cecelyne
    - Not "better"
    - Struggles to believe she's truly supported
    - Falls into the safety of routine

## Shaping combat

## Flow

### Established setting

- Vodak was the Last Beast under the Mountain
    - The last will of Mardukth
    - There should never be another Omphalos, another mountain that overshadowed the memory of his glory
    - Solar shadowclones ability is a combination of Mardukth's hate and memory
- Vodak was recently destroyed
- Gilmyne messenger is a willing martyr

### Start of the battle

- Very obvious fancy Cecelyne enters
    - Lover doesn't believe because she has absolute faith in the Surrender Oaths
- Lover initially balks at the shaping battle
    - Prejudiced against demons after having absolute mastery over them
    - Confident in her Deathlord passive immunity
    - Ignores Cecelyne as she sets the stage
- Lover intends to purely exert social force, then fall back to physical pain
- Cecelyne sets the metaphor of a prodigal daughter returning home
- Lover plies several forms of seduction
    - The Yozis asked for the aid of the Neverborn in the past
    - Demons lack the freedom to move freely in Creation
    - Slaves and resources can flow like water
    - She can offer many novel sensations for a demon
- Cecelyne no-sells the attempt
    - She is the original wish-granter
    - She's proud of her daughter's refined skills
    - Continuing the metaphor empowers the rejection
- Lover realizes that she'll have to engage in the shaping battle
    - Refutes Cecelyne's claim to parenthood
    - She was the brightest daughter of UCS and still rejected him

### The vivisection

#### Framing

- Cecelyne reaffirms her identity
- Cecelyne then affirms Lover is BSI with the necklace
    - Neverborn Torment never comes
    - Cecelyne is explicitly blocking it
    - To bear such is the duty of a parent
    - The pain of the dead is frozen in time and fades
    - The living must always bear fresh pain
- Cecelyne clarifies that she knew _of_ every Solar but they met at the Surrender
- They visually go back in time to show that Cecelyne is Cecelyne
- Lover relives setting up the vivisection of Cecelyne's fetich soul
- Lover acknowledges that her foe must have been there but refuses to believe it's Cecelyne

#### Rewriting history

- Cecelyne recounts the events
- Asks Lover about how she felt
    - Lover refuses to engage but is subconsciously reminded
- Cecelyne mentions having another soul observe the process
    - Lover insists that didn't happen
    - It's the word of one witness against another, and who is to say that an enthusiastic young sorceress wouldn't make a mistake?
    - That "young sorceress" was the best and a veteran who would never be taken by surprise.
    - Brigid was actually the best, and that hubris is what made the blind spot.
