# Dance with the Dead

[[__TOC__]]

## Send the Signal

It is said that demons, more than any other, fear the disquiet dead.

Common wisdom holds that it is a matter of pride. No matter how might they corrupt a soul, corruption is a lesser evil than destroying it entirely. This is not true, but it touches on the real reason.

Scholars say that it is a matter of fear. Demons are only unclean spirits, and all spirits are immortal unless purged by a mighty hero-priest. That is, unless they are starved. The dead and the lands of the dead can drain a spirit of its essence entirely. The truly hideous among the dead can do so in but a moment.

Demons, then, fear these creatures which make them as vulnerable as the mortals on which they prey. This explanation, too, is incomplete.

Demons have stronger innate natures than any other spirits, save the stagnant dead themselves. There is a great deal of variety in these demonic natures, but there are a handful things in common. They value only strength. They hate the gods and their mortal servants who cast them into the infernal realm. Most of all, they recognize the disquiet dead for what they truly are– in the cosmic sense.

Even the weakest enslaved demon would sooner risk annihilation for breaking a contract than to face the peril of death-without-end. Yet here one was: a _Dancer at the Saigoth Gate_. That kind was a living pillar of silver flame which the human brain misinterpreted as a human dancer. Scholars had wasted decades and untold fortunes trying to discover the Saigoth Gate. The truth was that the demons were probably just bullshitting. Much like this one certainly was.

The Thirteen Great Deathlords had been disgraced several times in recent decades, centuries of growing terror undone by the foolish among their number. The demon's torturer had herself put up a facade of being inconsequential, but she had never given an appearance of weakness. By no means should a mere serf of the demon realm approach her keep fearlessly.

The Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears, the Great Deathlord of Debauchery, smiled vapidly and tipped the amphora of pyreflame slightly further.

The silver flame that was the demon's body and mind squirmed and screamed in ecstasy and agony. Its spirit was confused by the addition of new flame which in defiance of nature caused it to contract instead of grow. The inverse flames of death were inimical to its very being, for there was nothing they would not consume.

The immaterial demon was held captive by ropes braided of saints' hair, dyed and defiled in their own fluids. Even so bound, the Dancer sought to dance, and the ropes grew tighter as it twirled. So too, the Lover danced, for sympathy often bought confessions. She smiled and danced and looked as lovely and terrible as any of the demon princes. Yet still, this least of demons danced its lie.

_The Mother of Rites sees forever and is forever. Even now, she walks to forever. She has journeyed to The End and to your end. She returns with it in her arms. Long has your Mother mourned for you, and she comes to take you home._

Demons often thought they were poets or prophets. The proud among them bragged for their skill in music without fail. So often had the Lover dragged them screaming from their prison to perform for some debauched spectacle before feeding their spirit-bodies to the participants. Nothing of this sort would move her, not that anything ever did. She was the ideal lover, and ideals were by nature devoid of passion.

Yet this little ditty concerned her practically. The cores of the Thirteen Great Deathlords were some of the most dangerous Revenant Traumas. Should one of the Deathlords ever truly fail, the tatters of their human soul would be seared clean from the Trauma, and it would be used as the basis of a new member. By the nature of an incarnate trauma, though, most Revenants resisted such captivity and service. They prowled the depths of the underworld as the reality-scraping nightmares they were.

The Last Beast Beneath the Mountain had been snuffed out last month. Every Revenant Trauma had a palpable effect on the whole of the underworld. Most dead unconsciously accepted them. Perhaps only a creature so jaded and focused as the Lover would notice that every ghost and specter had abruptly become less self-absorbed and stubborn, if only by a sliver. The Last Beast's hunger and deep grudge had passed from the spirits of the dead. One of the great shackles which bound the underworld had broken.

The Whispers of the Dead Below argued amongst themselves. They argued over whether the Last Beast's passing was a good thing. They argued over what had caused it. The Lover was no oracle of theirs; she had her spies to divine the truth. They had failed. Her spies never failed, not unless she intended it from the beginning.

It was almost certainly a hero, though who among them was so skilled at ferreting out sleeper agents? No such individual should be operating in this part of the world. Could a young one have gone dark and evaded her before she thought them a threat? The situation was unusual.

Yet there was a scent on the air, an unmistakable dry incense. The demeanor of the living in her domain was twisting against their will. They were becoming harsher and cleaner. They were reaching more to acts of ceremony. These were all habits of the dead, but they did not come from the Lover or from the Dead Below.

The Revenant Traumas were the shards of the slain Makers, and their will be done among the dead. So too, the damned Makers impressed upon the demons. Dead, damned, or otherwise departed, there were no Makers left to influence the world of the living.

Certainly, the heroes of hell and of the underworld could bring the influence of their masters with them. But this was too strong, too quick. In spite of the attack's subtlety, this was a sudden, obvious show of power – but only to those who already knew what to see. A favored tactic of the Mother of Rites – revelations to those initiated in her doctrines.

The Lover had no special relation to that demon prince. Not really. She had been an avid demonlogist in life, so perhaps she had tasted more of the demons' two-faced jailer than most. Perhaps she had communed with the Forty Prophets which comprised the prince's spiritual body more than anyone. But in the ways of sympathetic magic, that provided no link. She had given the demon prince no special reason to cast its gaze upon her.

The Lover almost let her smile break for a moment. She was not anxious. She was not frustrated. All emotion had truly left her. The memories of these things dwelled in the Trauma which was her core and in the curdled chemical impulses of her corpus, but she was too old to feel those. What was this sensation, then?

To reassert herself, she poured the rest of the pyreflame onto the demon. It coughed and sputtered and spun. The ghastly flame of the underworld gave up a great toxic plume, but silver fire of the demon's body resisted impurity to the last. It spun about and tried to cast out the foreign essence.

It reminded the Lover of something, but she was far too old to remember all of her myriad experiences. She mentally shrugged and summoned her servants to lick the floor clean of the demon's salted stain.

## Loved to Death

The Lover's citadel, the Fortress of Crimson Ice, was both ghastly and functional. The source of the ice's color was obvious, but where _that_ came from was really quite fun. And perhaps of all the Thirteen Great Deathlords, only the Lover compelled ancient malevolent specters to re-finish the decor more than to destroy.

She didn't need them to strike down heroes. Each spirit was broken by her own hand. Only she could be trusted to do it right.

So too was the case for lesser creatures. Really, for a Deathlord, the Lover was surprisingly busy. Accordingly, she only rarely haunted her own supposed center of power.

She did not arouse fear with a colossal monster like that illiterate. She did not inspire despair with a tireless army of the dead like that child playing warmaster. She was a "respected" figure in the regional community. That meant she spent a great deal of time traveling or in courts she "advised."

Nothing drove the life and love out of mortals like generational servitude. The grinding burden of tradition and the hopelessness of improving one's lot. She just had to make sure the right people stayed on the right path. She did this personally. Only she could be trusted to do it right.

They all loved her with a fiery passion. And she would stoke that fire. And stoke it. And stoke it. They would ask for rest, but surely, they did not want to disappoint her? And there were drugs for that anyway. And magic. And then maybe something new.

It was not always lavicious, though it usually started that way. She had to keep up appearances, after all. But no matter how spiritual or intellectual a pleasure, the fire for it could not be stoked forever. And so the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears turned joy to ash.

These enlightened leaders would spread their bleak wisdom, break their people down with cruelty before they could learn the desolation at the end of love.

Foremost among these places was the twin kingdom of Gradafes and Dead Gradafes. The king of the White Ram was a simpering fool like his forebears. He still lived because in his wretchedness, his hunger had not yet been sated. The king of the Black Ram was some fool ancestor of his. The dead king had died by a foolish accident and took the place of the previous by the black humor of it more than merit.

That is, the living king and the dead were selected solely by virtue of being a hair more than boring. Yet it had been many years since either had been replaced. Perhaps today, one would dull enough to warrant the effort of re-organizing regional intrigues. Well, it was not so great a burden. Gradafes was merely a petty kingdom of wealthy shepherds.

The two kings had separately begged their mistress to visit, claiming a great, historic development. She would destroy them if that was not the case. Rather, she would probably destroy one of them regardless since they were certainly trying to share the same thing. So, even if the development was a bust, she would at least have the pitiful amusement of pressing one of the kings to soulsteel.

In the places ruled by Deathlords, the realms of the living and the dead were like a black mirror. The highest classes of spirits, such as the Deathlords themselves, existed in both sides at once. The Lover entered the White palace and the Black palace at once. If little else, the kings could be proud of the slaves opening the doors together in spite of their blindness to the opposite realm.

The Deathlord sauntered into the palaces, mortal and ghost bowing to her even while in the presence of their respective king. The peoples of Gradafes knew their owner. Not that it mattered so much. The affections of wool merchants was cheaply bought. The only things of value here were the rare breed of sheep and the ancient stone palace, both of which were simply inherited. Perhaps if the Lover grew truly bored, she would replace the nation entire.

For now, she bothered herself with the kings' affections. They drank her as she entered, then they stumbled over themselves, speaking of some new wing of the palace recently opened. Apparently, it was new in both the White palace and the Black. That meant it was older than any ghost in Dead Gradafes – not that she imagined any even matched herself in age.

The stone palace was certainly nothing impressive. Still, it was older than anyone knew. It was old when she had ruled this region in life. Impressive for a structure which predated the overthrow of the Makers but nothing more.

Perhaps that was it, then. This buried wing of the palace had some treasure of the Makers. Yet then it should only exist in the White palace. It took tremendously powerful dead or generations of more common kind in order to produce an underworld reflection of a living place.

A prize worthy of study, then, if it appeared in both places. The Lover almost remembered how she had loved such discoveries. Then again, that nature had driven her to necromancy long before her death and affixion to a Trauma.

She commanded both kings to lead with a single breath. Each thought she spoke only to him and hurried with hungry purpose. How dull.

She allowed herself to be led. At the rear of the palace was an ancient gate that had somehow been concealed from her life-piercing gaze. She could not see beyond it in either realm. Beyond simply lay a void. It was not _the_ void, and she could feel warm currents blowing gently from the cool dark.

"What have you learned of it?"

"Little more than we already knew, dearest lady," both men said at once, with slightly different affectations. "My family has long held a prophecy that such a door would appear on a holy day when our efforts would be rewarded. I dared not waste your time on superstition, but this speaks the legend true."

The Lover did not miss the hidden message.

"What lies beyond?"

"It was called the Third Place in the prophecy. It is like nothing we have known. Dear lady, I beg you witness its beauty firsthand. It is nothing like yours, of course, but it would be a fairer place for your visage than these rough halls."

There was something in those words. She could compel absolute honesty from either man, but that would be a loss. Not to the mortals, per se, but certainly to the peer she wished least of all to hold advantage over her. In his paranoia, he would no doubt hear of today's events.

What did a Deathlord have to fear from the Makers' remnants anyway? They were half made from the Traumas of the Dead Below. The Lover entered the gateway, and of course the kings shut it behind her.

## B-Sides

The Third Place was dark but not utterly so. Countless lights glimmered all around from a great distance. The air was rarefied and smelled vaguely familiar. It was too cold for mortals, save when a warm breeze passed. There was no ground to stand on, but that hardly mattered for a ghost.

"It is wonderful to see you again!" cried a proud voice.

A woman walked toward her. In spite of the chill, the stranger was dressed for warm climes. Loose robes in white and blue were draped about her olive skin. Silver hair floated and flowed like a decaying halo, sometimes only long enough to cover one eye and sometimes drifting into the middle distance. Where her slippers alighted on the void, she left newborn stars.

"I come bearing gifts at reasonable prices."

The woman's tone was powerful, clear, and certain. She did not seem infatuated by the Lover's charms and enchantments, but she still maintained eye contact. None could resist the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears, whether cenobite or sybarite.

When the Lover spoke, her own voice was sweet and bitter like richly-aged desert wine, "They are no gifts if they have price, dearest."

"All gifts have price," the stranger replied, lifting her voice as if it were some great joke. "I am honest about mine."

"I only hope I possess enough to afford what wonders you must bear, if you are so certain."

So this was the trick. Her slaves had dug up some lost devil belonging to the Mother of Rites. It could touch the underworld because of some symbolic affinity with the Void. Novel, for certain. A once in a lifetime event, even for spirits. Only, each Deathlord's life had been full of such things.

The devil continued: "To start, I will return you something which was once yours. I ask mainly that you keep this generosity in mind when I name the prices to come. Yet I also ask you consider what this first gift truly means. A trivial task for one such as yourself."

From her sleeve, the woman drew a necklace. A chain of sun-gold glimmered, but it was put to shame by shards of hoary rime which stung the eye. The woman carelessly slung it from one finger into the Lover's lap.

The Deathlord froze. She forgot, for just a moment, her pageantry. Her smile cracked.

A stranger had come to her court and not given a name.

A Deathlord had no name to give. They were bestowed a title by the Dead Below which had forged them and earned many more from the souls they terrorized. Their former names were cast Below.

A name was power and identity. For a Deathlord to claim a name was to lay claim to a life so deeply buried. Any who sought to unearth a name which had been cast Below were struck down by the Dead Below themselves.

The Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears had no name to give, but this stranger had named her. The Deathlord floated in silence for a long moment. She waited for the Dead Below to take the devil's eyes from their sockets or for Void to spill from her own body, rupturing her insides. The resentment of their masters was the only thing the Deathlords feared.

The stranger broke the silence and smirked.

"I give back to you the name you made yourself. My price is that you _remember_ that person, Bright Shattered Ice. Remember yourself, most brilliant of the Sun-Chosen. If you are to wear my kin's shattered bones, then even death will not relieve you of that burden. The Dead may forgive you, but forgiveness has nothing to do with penance."

The Deathlord's hand quivered. It wasn't fury. It couldn't be. She puffed out her chest for a different reason for the first time in thousands of years. She stripped herself bare of illusions after countless lifetimes. The necklace burned in her hand. The sun-gold was trying to destroy her dead spirit, and the ice from the dead Maker's body still sought vengeance.

"Who are you, really?"

"I am as was prophesied," the devil said. "I am the Third Place – the most ancient Firmament which has always looked down upon kingdoms and lands, which scorns even the middle air which bears the celestial lights. It was from my heights that the Creator-King descended, and it was by my lights that the order of all things was set. I am Star-Fixer, Law-Maker, Mother of Rites and Passages. I am Forever and Everywhere, the Way to and Warden of All Things."

She raised her hands in benediction, and the silver sands of the demon realm poured freely. The Lover gnashed her teeth.

It couldn't be. Even when the Sun-Chosen had cut and divided the Makers so that they might fit in a prison that was less than themselves, the Mother of Rites had never taken human shape. She denied to the end being less than the night sky and all its constellations.

"Do not think me a fool. I helped pen the oaths which bind the damned. None could escape, and no vessel could hold their spirits."

"There's that old pride in your work. Not as dead as you let on. Oh, don't worry. Your contracts still bind the damned. I am just no longer a member of that category. And with certain respect to eternity, I never was."

Every hero, somewhere in the depths of their soul, remembered that they were made to cast down the Makers from their cruel, high thrones. Bright Shattered Ice had been among the first. And had been among those to command a true kill, adding to the count of the Dead Below.

Now she was in thrall to them. Though alone in this place, the power of death she wielded was among the greatest. It was certainly more than the meager powers she had commanded when she had shattered her hoary lord.

If demons despised heroes and feared the dead, then even a demon prince should cower before a Deathlord, most of all this one.

The alleged Maker did not flinch as the former hero gathered her power. It had always been that way. Fearless and senselessly proud unto death, until the Creator-King bowed and the rest surrendered.

In truth, Bright Shattered Ice had done more than write the oaths of the damned. She had directed and taken pleasure in the spiritual vivisection required for the Makers to fit in that miserable hell. She knew the very insides of most of them. If this devil were truly the Mother of Rites, keeper of the histories and traditions among the Makers, she would know this. She would fear what Bright Shattered Ice had become.

But there was no reaction. A fraud. A confident one.

It would not matter. There were few in this era who could understand, much less participate in battle as the Makers knew it.

## The Shape

What did it mean to make a world? What did it mean to bring battle to Makers of worlds?

Certainly, their lesser components – the subordinate demons which rose from their thoughts – could be slain by sword or fire. Even now, the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears was confident she could slay the Forty Prophets and cripple the Mother of Rites. But to cripple was not to destroy.

Some of the Makers fell by blade regardless, for each coveted a single proud demon as their heart. These, if discovered, could be slain through great effort and sacrifice. To do so would shatter the Maker which relied upon them.

Rare was a Maker caught so off-guard, but so most had fallen. Yet some Makers fell in personal combat.

To slay a Maker at once, a hero need must fight as a Maker fights. To destroy by act of divine creation.

The dead of course were sterile in spirit, but they could rot, misremember, and defile all things. Giving profane life to nightmares was just as powerful.

Each fighter assumed a stance. This was as much an ethical stance as a physical one. It was the shape each impressed on the fabric of reality.

The Lover shrouded herself in glamor once more, making herself so beautiful as to break the heart of beauty. Only, it was not rouge on her lips but promises. Her eyes sparkled not with desire but with hope. From the pale shell of a wanton ghost arose a creature of starlight and childlike wonder. When she opened her mouth, every breath was a song to itself.

She seemed naked, for no armor could be as bold or strong as Innocence. Still, she was wrapped in the warmth of wings which were Flights of Fancy. Hidden among their feathers was the black iron knife Betrayal. A great whip called Loss danced about her, so that it could strike from any corner. Yet greater than any of these things was her leaden crown Ennui.

The Makers were as predictable as they were monstrous. At least this impostor got that part right.

The devil stretched to immense size, shedding her legs in a cloud of cosmic dust. From her torso fell an armored tail. Yet she did not become a serpent. A horizon-crushing scorpion descended, each spike on its armor a star. Its soul-shredding pincers were the scale which weighed justice.

The Lover saw now why the devil had taken human form. She was the stinger on the beast's tail, for demons knew no venom greater than their defeat at the hands of mortals.

The so-called Star-Fixer had no need of regalia, for a Maker was Beginning and End, a story contained within itself. This made them and their demons easy to read in every sense so long as you knew the story – and the Lover knew them all.

The Mother of Rites had been a dreamer. As a demon prince, she was now cynical and pointlessly cruel, but it seemed this devil was still a dreamer. That meant she could be captured by longing as much as any mortal.

The fundamentals were always reliable. Love was oft born from fear. The Lover's wings shimmered black as they unfurled, and the void between the stars became the Void Below. Demons, more than any other, fear death everlasting.

This was to do battle as the Makers, to bend reality to your will, one lie at a time.

The demon beast shook itself, and silver sand was cast from its shell. The Void devoured the grains, but still they poured. Milky paths were strewn across the firmament, gentle roads to oblivion.

"Did I stutter?" the devil said. "I am the Way to All Things. I have overcome the weakness of my kind. I am the Way, even to The End."

Loss tried to bind one of the beast's legs, but it could find no purchase. The scorpion trod the stars on claws of Liberation. There was nothing the Lover could take from the devil.

That couldn't be. The Mother of Rites could no more free herself than she could unbind the stars she had fixed in the primeval sky. No demon could escape, but least of all their warden. She could lie and cheat and utterly defile the spirit of the laws she made, but she could not break them. Even if this was one of her Prophets sealed away before her damnation, it could no more escape her nature.

What was this devil, then? The child of a different Maker, pretending for advantage?

The fear had not worked, but she would press forward with the next stage.

"Why do you reject my touch, love?" Her voice was every betrayed lover. "Did you not come for me? How could you toy with me so?"

If the battlefield was the cast of the stars, then she would be the forlorn maiden. Her eyes and hair shimmered as she shifted to that archetypal pose.

"Dry your eyes, _daughter_. Your mother has brought you gifts a-plenty."

A counterattack. And one which reaffirmed the original context instead of where the Lover had tried to shift it. But the devil would need to support it.

"Are you cold, little one? Mother has brought you a fine coat."

The Lover was a master of receiving and rejecting gifts. Who would not shower her in material affection? To keep the gift would be to accept the weakness of the parent-child dynamic. She could turn it about easily, but perhaps there was a better option. To reject a gift with such supporting narrative would cost her story momentum. Often defense was a losing game.

The demon beast extended a world-crushing pincer so gently. In it was a coat called Memory. As a coat, it was too fine a gift by far. The demon princes could craft such works, but they were obviously filled with malice where this one held none. Yet, it was the fur of the Last Beast Under the Mountain, and its rustles echoed the unforgotten past.

Deathlord or no, such Memory would crush her.

"Dearest Mother, such finery would better go to one of my siblings. It is too great for one as humble as I."

"Nothing is too great for my my most brilliant princess. I wish only for you to look your best for your first day in the light after so long. Your cousins can be so cruel."

A weaker followup, but the overall burden was immense. She could refuse it by dint of death. She could twist the scenario to tragedy. But trying to shift the narrative so far after her initial failure would exhaust her. Yet, would Memory not destroy her?

No. She was too much ash for that. She could not crumble any further, even should the weight of the Mountain press.

She curtsied as she bowed under the weight of the coat, and the curtsy was chains of obligation and affection. The thin bonds should have meant little, but the colossal monster tugged at them gingerly.

The Lover was less introspective. If she was ash, she was being made to read the rings of the tree she had been in life. She should have felt nothing. It was all old wounds. Yet the immensity of Memory made them feel new again.

The Trauma at her core only needed a few moments more to assert itself and kill them. Yet a few moments could stretch to… Forever... within a narrative.

Her eyes went wide. They had been the shape of hope so they might ensnare a dreamer. Now they had lost focus and become only the eyes of a lost child. She struggled to regain control. Any major shift in such battles often spiraled toward a final resolution.

"You said your gifts came at a cost, Mother. What must I pay for a coat so fine?"

"You know, don't you? So much cleverer than all your friends. You could never help it."

Such a petty attack should have meant nothing, but the Lover had made herself vulnerable.

"Do you want Mother's advice? You'll have it any time you ask."

Few options remained. The Lover had lost the narrative battle and would soon be swept up in some infantilizing spiritual regression. The Dead Below would destroy and torture her, but they did not steal her mistakes from her. Maybe the corruption of demons was not a lesser evil after all.

She didn't try to maintain cohesive narrative at all. This was a freedom of mortals which she still held as a ghost.

"I'm an adult, Mother Dearest. Kindly go back to hell!"

She had no time to work a great art of necromancy, which was the fullness of her strength. She had no time for much of anything, nor would she. False or true Maker, this devil held Time in its vicegrip. Instead, the Deathlord simply let the self-loating roil from the depths of her Trauma.

That was the truth, really. She had hated what she had become and had wanted to die long before the end came. The Maker she had cast Below placed in her ghost the Trauma which represented that act of heroism, seen from the side of the slain. Even if she had not been so thoroughly burned out, who could hold passion when confronted with such direct evidence of its consequence?

The power of death was the negative of all things. In proper shape, it could reverse or destroy whatever it touched. Like destroys like. There was no demon which did not hate itself for its damnation.

The monster stumbled backward. There was no symbolism here. Only the hammer of death ever after. Its claws sizzled and popped as the thing tried to shield itself. The stars all around dimmed as the incarnation of the Third Place was wounded.

"What good does it do to tempt me now? We're both already dead!"

A slip of the tongue from mental fatigue. Of course, that only contributed to the self-loathing. The Lover piled all her resentment into the tearing necromantic blast as it pinned the beast.

"Oh, Mother knew all along!"

She had forgotten about the tail. An attack from above.

Soon. Soon. The moment stretched.

The strike never came.

The devil's human-shaped stinger hung suspended nearby. Her expression barely reflected that her lower half was still being disintegrated. A twitch of the eyebrow as she blotted out the pain. Only as much as a persistent nuisance.

"I realize," the devil said. "I have been unkind. This is not why I came. Old habits. I still think in the manner of my former kin. I am the Firmament, and my spendors are clear to all. I have no need to impress."

The narrative battle had collapsed, which left only the physical battle. At that moment, it became obvious that the devil had not lied. The distance between the Lover's attack and the scorpion increased to Forever. In spite of logic, the tail stretched the distance anyway. The Lover sighed and let her resentment pass, the blast fading with it.

The Mother of Rites was the Firmament. Attacks could never reach the highest heavens without extensive preparation. Such was difficult when she too was Forever. She could counter-prepare and outlast anything. The Lover realized she had no hope of victory in her present condition.

The Star-Fixer's battle stance broke, and she was suddenly just a person again. The stars shone in her eyes, but that was all. When she spoke, the sense of cosmic theatre, of a mad divinity, had left. She was still unshakably confident and optimistic, but that was all.

"I have one final gift for you, Bright Shattered Ice. But if you accept it, it will be the first of many. I wish to make true all I have said. As soon as I had a few hundred years to think, to watch humans go about their business, I found you all quite charming. You in particular showed so much potential. It was like your star was fixed as a new pole.

Well, other things happened. They tend to, without us guiding the world… or just being the problem ourselves…

What was left of the old me hated to see what you had become. Of course, being what I had become, I relished your becoming as two-faced as I was. Now I am more. I am free. And I can give a part of that freedom to you.

I have already taken your name from the Dead Below. If I strike you down, you will return to the cycle of reincarnation. I will vouchsafe your soul against any spirit who seeks vengeance for what you have done in your despair. But there is another option."

"Becoming your 'daughter.' Trading one master for another."

"Yes. But I will fix all you desire in the stars."

"Better monster than you have tried."

The demon prince smirked.

"I am well-practiced at twisting wishes. More than any other. Have faith that _Mother Dearest_ has your best interests at heart.

Honestly, dear, you did _all this_ – tried to destroy the world and everything – because of an unrequited love. You contributed so much to human collapse over some schoolyard drama. What's the worst I could do? Knock over your sandcastle?"
