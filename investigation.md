The Sidereal Exalted have always been overworked. Merely one-hundred special investigators to root out corruption of all sorts in all corners of Creation. They are forced to rely upon a web of connections to do their thankless tasks. Mortals whose destinies can be altered, Exalted whose passions can be inflamed, spirits who are only corrupt enough to accept bribes through official channels: these are the tools of the Bureau of Destiny.

Sometimes, there may be criminals who cannot be punished. They are too powerful, by personal might or by connections. Perhaps the Chosen conducting the investigation is alone or at risk of unsettling the delicate balance of connections in the area. No Star-Chosen has ever held a perfect record of enforcement.

None until Trishula Murmur, the "worst Chosen of Secrets," who was becoming known to the Bureau as the nuclear option for any investigation.

With a zeal for justice which sometimes reminded Bronze Faction elders of the late Pinnacle of the Hunt, she left no enemy of Heaven to their own devices. Webs of contacts centuries in the making could be burned down in one night. But she wasn't clumsy about her destruction. Every investigation was thorough; her evidence was ironclad. And when she struck, she burnt conspiracies to their deepest roots.

Yet her methods left her always on the edge of some grand censure. Not even the greatest Seer could have been so effective in ferreting out corruption. She was the daughter of the Demon Vicar, and the damned delighted in hunting the children of those who had cast them beyond the world.

Trish focused on letting the _glories_ flow through her. She felt them deeply, savored them for a moment, then let them go. The respect and subordination of her peers. Their frustration toward her methods and resentment for the benefits she received undeserved. Their spite for their quarry tonight, a god whose death Heaven would not lament. Their excitement for the fight to come, where they would see their leader shine in battle again.

It was not uncommon for Seers to prefer direct combat, matching wits with steel instead of with silver or the like. It was perhaps rare for this tendency to manifest in a Chosen of Secrets, but none would have questioned the prowess of Grandmaster Kejak's reincarnation. Only, that wasn't the source of Trish's fixation on violence.

She raised both hands at once and opened her burning emerald eyes as the familiar yantra burst into balefire which burrowed into the marble floor. The fire was as much in her heart, flickering with pride and loathing. The world was consumed by a cycle of violence which would spin itself anew if she left the least thread remaining. She had to burn it all away in one shot.

"Come to us, o Grieving Lord!"

The sign _Gervesin_ shone with the green light of his father, hell's sun. It was surrounded by occult accoutrements and things which represented the Demon Emperor. At the center of the once-holy geometry lay a bit of worn bone. The bone could no longer be distinguised as a martyr's knuckle, having been clasped in prayer by so many hands. The monster itself, _Gervesin_, rose from its sign.

To the uninitiated, it seemed a tall, hairless man, strangely smooth like a worn statue. His skin was the color of a young tree's bark, save for the elaborate runes of brass covering his back. Only a skirt of some red leather preserved his modesty. Yet, that was only half the truth, and Trish simultaneously saw him for what he was at heart.

Gervesin was the spear and banner of the Green Sun, the great brass lance _the Light Unnatural_. The tattered flag of his father and smith yet still clung to his side. Yet there was a greater shroud which fluttered proudly, the banner of an old soldier who loved his city enough to stand against the weapon of blight incarnate.

Gervesin-the-man knelt and wept as he clutched the martyr's long-lost knuckle. He held it to his heart, and it passed within him.

"Another fragment of my beloved returned. I will lay it to rest. Oh, woe that you were not born earlier, that you might have saved it from such abuse. Ah, but he would have wanted it to be a comfort if could serve. You did not take this one too harshly, did you, my godchild?"

The demon was tall for a human shape but not especially so. He stood at eye level with Trish, who was both already quite tall and wore absurdly high geta.

"I know you, Gervy. It was a fair trade. Yozis know Ma keeps enough crap around for relic swaps like these."

"You have my deepest thanks, as always."

It was not proper for the Herald of the Green Sun to lower his head, but he did so.

"My thanks, and..."

Trish clapped, and the fires extinguished. The ritual was completed without binding. The wicked artifact was free.

"Did you really think I would leave you hanging? It's a long way to Kinnojo's grave, so let's get this taken care of before Sifu notices I did this again."

The demon smiled and burned his true shape into the world. The horrid spear of creeping verdigris alighted in Trish's hand, a glove inscribed with hellish circuitry keeping the rotting light from consuming her. It sparked and sputtered as she did what had been thought impossible in ages past – attuned to the evocations of Ligier's own lance.

Gervesin had been there the day when Trish was presented before the Demon Princes, the first Calibration after she was born. He had forseen she would stand at the vanguard of a great battle, wielding an archetypal spear. He had sworn he would be that spear. This was not that battle, but each summoning drew the pair closer in combat instinct. She was not like his Lord Father; she knew the love and sadness Kinnojo had taught him. She would be stronger.
