# The Remakers on Ethics

It was rare that the five Remakers made obvious appearance. Each preferred to walk the world without special notice and to weigh upon only that which interested them intimately. For all five to gather was a declaration, and those who could feel it in the dragon lines, it was a fathomless terror.

The wrath of one might be checked, but it would exhaust the combined might of the Chosen hosts. Two might fall to the combined power of the Thirteen Deathlords, but some had been slain, and one at least had turned. Against all five Remakers, there could be no remedy.

Yet there was one more factor which held them to their inconsequental wandering, which kept them from grasping the throat of the world. They had a leader – or at least a secretary. The role was deliberately vague. They all implicitly knew, but there was no need to let wandering eyes see what could not be understood.

Five Makers Remade had come at the call of one human. This was the Mother of the Little Heroes, Chosen of Humans. This was Lillun, and all her Lilliputians were in attendance.

So too was the Adamant Empress and her Electors. This was afforded to them, for the pauper Lillun doted dearly on her younger sister the Empress. A few lesser powers were allowed presence at the request of the Remakers. Others attended remotely or through proxies they thought the powerless Lillun could not detect.

She allowed this, for the strength of the small was always through underestimation. That would be a major topic of today's gathering.

"My beloved children," she began, her voice like the bittersweet honey of summer flowers, "I am glad that you could find your way here safely.

O wondrous Remakers, who wrought the world from dreams and dust and lessened yourselves so that you might not break it; o loving grandparents to us all – we have called to ask a question which only you might answer.

O ancient Makers, who have many souls and whose souls have souls of their own, how should a people care for their souls? What are the truest paths to morality and ethics?

Each of my children were Chosen for their earnest respect and steadfastness. I have no fear that each will seek to do the most good with their choices. Yet sometimes, there are no good outcomes. How should they decide between evils?

If we reduce the struggles of living persons to mere numbers, then will we not be as callous as the Despot Kejak? Even our language is broken, for it makes us forget that non-humans too have humanity, as did the Tyrant Merela, scourge of our eldest siblings the Mountain Folk.

I know enough of humans to realize there is no easy answer. Please, Makers of All, you who have seen worlds before this one, how might we best judge the way?"

## In the beginning

Before any words could be said, there was faint applause. The Lilliputians knew to keep silent in most cases, and the powers attending would not interrupt. One of the Remakers, the Mother of Rites, was giving a polite clap, but the slightly delayed pattern made it sound sarcastic.

All eyes turned to her. She was a lean, square-jawed woman who was either perfectly average or absolutely towering depending on how she wanted the viewer to feel. Her silver hair was short and pinned back on the left and changed length constantly on the right. Her shining azure eyes saw everything without blinking.

In the worlds before this one, she had been the sky, and constellations still glimmered under her olive skin. She was the Law and the Maker of Law, considered most learned of all things when most Makers sought to specialize.

It was she who had set the ancient codes which oppressed god and mortal alike. In a respect, it was she who had laid the foundation for the Divine Rebellion. There was much she could tell.

"Well," she said, her voice hollow and gritty like stardust upon the void, "this can be a short meeting. Because there's no real guideline.

Oh, sure, there is. There's plenty. I wrote a bunch, and then the idiots after me wrote worse ones. But it all misses the point, really. Ethics is a hobby of the comfortable."

The Remakers neither agreed nor disagreed strongly on most topics. It could be better said that they had very little in common. Here, all gave their assent.

The Maker of Self-Image had ironically been broken and reembodied in the hero Fumia. She was an immense woman with bronze skin and shock-white hair. Her every movement drew the eye, for her personal gravity caused a fish-eye effect.

"Of course," she said, her fiery voice like an omnipresent narrator. "You're not going to think about any of that when you're fighting for survival."

The Maker of _Things_, Autochthon, knew the most about this sort of subject. He was least of their kind in the same manner that humans were the weakest of apes. He had no mighty cosmic force to call his own, so he had been driven to build Things which could strike them down.

Yet even now, he seemed the runt. His human shape was inexpertly crafted. He was genetically ugly, and his limbs weren't quite right, making his movements instinctively sickening to watch. Even among the humans in the audience without supernatural blessings, he seemed by far the lowliest.

"I–" he eventually said, like a gasp of steam from a boiler. "Yes. It's always unfair. Even I… committed grave sins against mortals. I have never been judged for them. I was 'the good one,' so no one ever blamed me. Was that right? How should I have made up for what I did?

Worse, what about my people? I wanted revenge. I wanted it to be fair. But the brutality the gods and humans showed? How could I pay for _that_ sin? And who would charge me on behalf of the dead or the damned?"

Adorjan, Maker of Freedom, smiled and threw up her arms. Her teeth were ceramic blades, and her skin was like painted bisque. She was short and slim in a way that made her look oddly long. Even here, she played with a white-bladed knife, twirling it as she spoke.

"You need to learn everyone and love everyone to be really fair," she said, her voice a whisper in every listener's ear, "But who has the time for it? So people invent a pretend game. It's not _really_ fair, but everyone knows the rules ahead of time, and that _sort of_ counts. Isn't that right, Cecececececy?"

The Maker of Nature opened and shut her mouth. She pursed her lips and did not interrupt.

"Oh yeah, it was all bullshit," Cecelyne said, leaning back and folding her hands behind her head. "This was the first world where things were _real_. It was all new to us too. And everyone immediately wanted the new rules.

So I made bullshit rulings on top of the existing bullshit rulings. It's not like I didn't gather information and amend them afterward. There's no red tape when you _are_ the Law. But the foundation was broken to begin with.

Hey– has anyone here considered that the act of slaying or damning one of my kind produces, in fact, _infinite_ suffering? If we're talking purely math-wise. How each of us is an infinite world with infinite persons inhabiting us.

How do you account for that? Well, I decided early on that we would cheat. I made it so that individuals with only one higher soul aren't persons. Even, say, the Sun being my brother's 'favorite son' was more like getting affectionate to your dog when your child is a constant disappointment. I mean, we just thought Gaia was into that sort of shit, so..."

The Maker of Nature smiled in a vaguely threatening way.

It was the will of the Adamant regime that all things should be transparent. Officially, Lillun and her children were often criminals, but none of the Adamant Council would move against them. To do so would spark rebellion amongst the lowest peoples of their own territories. Of course, the Empress would break the teeth of anyone who laid hand on her elder sister.
