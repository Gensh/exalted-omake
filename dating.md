# The Lament of Princess Murmur

Another day, another conference about the appropriateness of certain inter-personal relationships for the new generation of Sidereals. Ayesha Ura sped her pace through the winding, abstract halls of the Cerulean Lute of Harmony. The Division of Serenity held sway over these sorts of affairs (and affairs they often were), so the Convention on the New Generation of Seers often met in the non-euclidean brothel which served as the Division's headquarters. Ayesha hated the place just as her master had – it was the single most audacious monument to Heaven's indolence. None of the pleasures which could be enjoyed here were held in healthy measure. Some rooms could even give hell's Street of Golden Lanterns a run for her money.

Today's hearing was over at last, and the Convention Chair was glad to be leaving both discussion and Lute behind her. It seemed like every week, one of the newcomers had their favorite on-again/off-again mortal fall in love with another. This time, the idiot Chosen of Endings had tried to arrange for the death of a Dragonblooded rival. Clever enough but a grossly irresponsible use of Bureau resources and disruption of Fate.

Besides, that particular Dynast was meant to die in battle next week.

Ayesha's sole apprentice and irredeemable devil's advocate, Trishula Murmur, followed at her heels. The representative of the younger generation on the Convention, Trishula had passionately talked a quite dire censure into house arrest and remedial training. Of course, that meant the offender was now well in her pocket. She was building an empire in plain sight, and no one was stopping her.

The foremost Sidereal Exalted sighed. Maybe that would be more useful than Kejak's legacy of cloak and dagger. Still, there was one thing she could appreciate about her apprentice even now.

"You argued with quite the fervor for someone who hasn't even had a relationship _within_ the rules. Unless you're about to reveal you're much more subtle than you've let on in all these years."

After all, Trish was "the worst Chosen of Secrets."

"It's _because_ we're so disconnected by all these rules that we've lost touch in the past. I get to have all my special exceptions because of my parents – and my _family_ keeps me normal. I get to _leave work_. I'm the only one who does. We've been so on guard against corruption that there's not much left to corrupt at the end of the day."

Many of the younger Seers' past lives would have vehemently disagreed, to say nothing of the old workaholic Kejak. They all lived fulfilling lives. They were just different lives. But the new generation grew up watching  grand stories of heroism unfold in the world beneath them. They grew up watching the gods gamble with lives. And so they hated the world they knew and tried to reach out to the earth, with its tales of sacred romance and tawdry trysts. It was understandable for such a charged period in their lives.

Instead, Ayesha said, "Yes, and I've seen the way your parents fall over each other. I'm surprised you're not the worst offender. No interest or just waiting for someone special?"

"You're prying a bit, aren't you, Sifu? Waiting for Kejak to sweep you off your feet again? Well, you're definitely not my type."

"Can't I have an interest in the trouble my apprentice is going to stir up before it explodes in my face again?"

Trish snorted. "Fair enough. I _am_ looking for someone special. Not waiting for Venus Herself to step in and plan me a match or anything, like the incident last month. I'm just looking for something in particular and don't have too many options."

"Talk about it loudly enough before we're out the door, and you may find it reaches you anway," Ayesha said dryly.

"Mm. Well, you know my Ma. I've got a lot of irons in the fire. I want to make her proud. Really proud. So that she doesn't feel so bad about all the rest. And I need someone who understands that and doesn't hate her."

"Alright, I'm following. Maybe a little thorny but nothing too terrible."

"Right, but also… you have to think about my situation. Who're all my eligible matches? We've got our Arcane Fate, and my Dad's an Infernal bigwig."

"A morally questionable Exalt or a demon? I think I see your problem. All your father's coworkers."

"I actually have _worse_ options. All the girls I meet in Creation? Nieces. Can you imagine me asking Biggest Sis for her granddaughter's hand in marriage? She'd hold it over me forever."

"Have you considered sabbatical in Lookshy?"

"Fuck Lookshy."

Ayesha chuckled in the back of her throat. She'd heard the same sentiment from the girl's mother how long ago? Not some elaborate plan of dealing with them or justification for a grudge. Just "fuck Lookshy." The Bureau Head cleared her throat.

"Language. You know the rules regarding expressing favoritism."

"Yeah, yeah. Like they weren't rob–"

Ayesha turned abruptly and glared. Her starmetal eye shimmered several shades of red.

"Yeah, yeah. No 'leaking' what has already been rumored for like a decade."
