# Lillun the Last

The second edition of _Exalted_ was a bit of a wild west of development. Even within the span of a single book, the contracted writers could take wildly different stances on the content. In one part, _Manual of Exalted Power: The Infernals_ was taken to be a throwback to the edgiest of 90s _World of Darkness_. It was taken to be a strictly evil book, where evil was defined in terms modern audiences would recognize.

As such, the Infernal Exaltations were bound to the body and spirit of a young girl who had been converted into a biotech monstrosity. It was the hobby and even duty of demons and Infernals alike to abuse this vessel in every way. There was a certain ease with which atrocities were not only mentioned but encouraged in the book which disgusted most audiences.

Depending on the reading of the Infernal induction process, it was possible that each and every player character was sexually abused. Following that, they were meant to become part of a cycle of abuse. The fallback target, when demons or less experienced Infernals were not present, was Lillun, the vessel.

This was of course unacceptable. It would be difficult content in passive fiction, to say nothing of participating in such a tabletop campaign.

While this did add to the beginning of the end of that style of book writing, Lillun was never actually retconned. Out of the tremendous amount of supplemental content – including rewriting one supplement (GWM) in its entirety – Lillun was never officially changed. It fell to each group which included major Infernals content to solve the Lillun Problem. Comparing alternate Lilluns was a minor recurring forum topic. I myself had maybe eight versions, who would appear depending on the needs of the campaign. Of course, none of mine were ever so popular as Xefas' _Coryphee of Hope_.

When I tried to return to Exalted, many years and retcons later, I was surprised to see tremendous pushback at the mere mention of Lillun. There was an overwhelming desire to totally erase the memory of that content. I probably should have expected some of it. Gone are most long, traditional campaigns, and a great deal of online participation is speculative "if I had a game, I'd..." content. The idea that I was providing content for tables which still included Lillun was… anathema.

The more modular approach of Third Edition means that, to this day, Lillun has _still_ not been retconned. Anyone who plays Infernals _stilL_ needs to solve the Lillun Problem. Of course, with the purges and the gigapause and all, most of my generation of fans are gone. The old discussions of what to do with Lillun are gone. There's just a bunch of newer players who'd rather physically remove most of the old Infernals manual and whose table canons have not been "tainted" by Lillun.

As if every canon Lunar wasn't a serial rapist. Well, the Third Edition retcons solved that of course. It's not surprising newer players would rather bury Second altogether. My offense is that some of them would bury the journeys we took with that content and would accuse us of reveling in sadism. As if we weren't the ones most concerned about what to do with this content we were obliged to use in the RPG culture of the time. As if there weren't a thousand plans to replace the Lillun content or to rescue the canon Lillun.

Of the canon characters I've played and of the Lilluns I've written, the final Lillun, "Lil Blue", is among the most endearing and enduring. She's something of a microcosm of the Infernals experience. She came from a place of weakness and made her own harm a strength. She's strong of will but haunted by the idea she may one day commit the same cruelties done to her. Most importantly, she _grew_ and became her own person. That was the core Infernals arc and one most players seemed to miss in the glamor of Devil-Tiger ascension.

Included here are a sampling of Lillun's stories, written long after my Exalted experience. This serves as a record, both of my own experience with the setting and of Lillun's own, truly, triumphant howl.
