# The ~~Un~~disputed Queen of Hell

The first generation of Green Sun Princes learned well of the Yozis' moods. They were blessed and cursed without warning, and the Exalted constantly bickered over who was more esteemed in their masters' favor. Demonic resources were driven one way or another as the Chosen and even the Unquestionable sent contradictory orders. In the end, the Makers-in-Exile were no closer to their glorious return.

The second generation, chosen according to shinmaic themes the Yozis only mostly remembered, came to find more order. The Yozis agreed to create something resembling a proper hierarchy for these outsiders. When that continued to be a mess, Malfeas plied both the emerald tongue of his foremost soul and his own obsidian-razored fist to ensure all of hell agreed to suborn their hierachies to his own. The Principle of Hierarchy could have a hundred-thousand titles of various import so long as they roughly corresponded to the five Malfeas dictated.

No title was to be "King," for who could compare to the ineffable glory of the Yozi King? The Phylactery-Womb was not "Queen" but "Queen-Mother," an honorary, ironic, and ultimately impotent title.

Yet that was not enough.

Malfeas was not _merely_ a king but an Emperor. The Green Sun was an Empyreal Grand Prince and so above any king regardless. There were yet _mortals_, mere humans, who called themselves "King." While the Green Sun Princes had mostly ceased caring, it rankled noble Ligier that none among his servants had stature in Creation to lord over such peons.

At the dawn of the second generation, he had declared a great contest of craft and at the end, produced four treasures to mock his lesser brother's Fulcrums. These, he took now and gave to four of his Chosen who were personally loyal to him above even his oversoul. At the fifth Althing Infernal, he proclaimed these to be his Kings of Infernal Virtue, who represented Malfeas' kingly personality as much as the Green Sun represented his unbroken Will.

Each of the Kings was a master of the Empyreal Cult, and the esteem of Ligier opened new doors in the theoretical framework of Theion charms they had built. Each was a glorious example of what Infernal Exalted could be, not things of warped flesh but of searing soul.

Of course, the problem was that Ligier had hardly changed. Such was still his hubris.

Each betrayed him.

The King of Conviction entered the Wyld in search of grander dreams and was lost to all, until their Exaltation returned to Lillun.

The King of Temperance defied their master for True Love and was cast to the great prison of the Endless Desert for a year and a day.

The King of Compassion refuted the magnanimous love of the Primordial King who sacrifices lessers for a greater good, and died to protect the insignificant.

The King of Valor was slain during the Lotus Massacre, before the first Sidereal had fallen.

The Green Sun collected his false Fulcrums once more and nearly destroyed them as sign of his wrath. He would never again trust humans to bear his glory, even if that glory was only an ironic mockery of his lessers. Yet, there was another. A way Ligier could salvage this experiment and turn its initial failure into still greater glory.

The last of the first generation, a rising star who never seemed to escape that label and become truly great. Formerly a penniless hunter who would have amounted to nothing. A backwards barbarian who had hated civilization and the Gaia's bastards who enforced it.

She had long worshiped the Green Sun, whose cold flames had extinguished the burning of that Fire Aspect who had destroyed her home. She had come to love the Demon City and its madness. She felt it the only honest face of "civilization." She believed without question the tales of the Empyreal Cult, who blamed Creation's degeneracy on the maiming of the Yozis.

Now at last, her deity would deign to speak with her. Ligier would sculpt her into a vessel of his magnamity. Not a lover, as his stupid brother's Queen had been. Not so independent and prone to indolence. The Green Sun would burn away the weaknesses of the Virtue Kings and create a perfect, pious child. The Daughter of the Green Sun, the Queen of Empyreal Will.

In a world carefully balanced between trading favors and pulling rank, there is an exception. More than the Hierophant of the Yozis, more than the Empyreal Chaplain, more than Kimbery's consort or Adorjan's spouse or any of the other pointless exceptions to the rules the Yozis have created, the Queen is a landmine.

Kyrie speaks for the Green Sun but lacks his wisdom and experience. She operates on youthful senses of justice and personal responsibility which have not matured since she took up the role. Though she has befitting dignity and a great mastery of Theion charms which compel love and obedience, she completes her objectives through strongarming other Chosen. This has created an extensive undercurrent of resentment first toward the Queen but also toward the Green Sun, who rarely corrects his wayward child.

Appeals have been made to Malfeas that she offends his dignity, but the Demon Emperor is loath to lose the most significant innovator of Theion charms, in the hopes that he may one day claim them as his own. In failing that, the Althing has passed several motions which restrict the abuses of higher-ranked Chosen. Limiting the strong galls Cecelyne, so most such articles now include exceptions or expansions of power for the Hierophant and the Chaplain to appease her hypocrisy.

There have even been pushes to grant Lillun genuine power. On the one occasion in which such a motion was passed, she refused the right, saying that such honors were beyond her station as a mere mortal. In reality, Lillun knows the Yozis would watch her more closely if she had any obvious authority. Instead, she guides her children to undermine her rival Queen and schemes for a manner of claiming Kyrie has plotted against her. To strike the so-fragile container of the Infernal shards is to threaten the designs of the Yozis themselves, something they will not tolerate even from the Green Sun's favorite.
