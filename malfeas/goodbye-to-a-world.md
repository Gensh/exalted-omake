It was not altogether strange for the Silent Wind of Hell to take her human shape and set forth across the Endless Desert to the free world beyond. Sometimes her spirit would pass through and become a brief calamity, but her body was ever rejected by the oaths she swore on her name and by the spite of the Desert Herself.

Regardless, the Wind always returned to pluck at the Desert's borders, as if they would ever be found wanting. Of course, as the damned spirit which embodied liberation, the Wind often liberated her own memories and would repeat her fruitless investigations.

The cycles of a cyclone were normal. What was peculiar this time is that she was not alone.

Her daughters, the four lesser Winds of Hell, accompanied her. They did not merely follow in her wake as they sometimes did, drawn by the vacuum of her passage. They had long ago been lost to madness and the mad gusts of hell. Yet now they walked on limbs of flesh. They spoke to one another and laughed.

Had the Silent Wind liberated them from their fallen state? What plan echoed in the Wind's hollow heart this time?

Hell was full of myriad tiny things which were not quite demons. These looked on as another figure arrived. The Wind's consort, an old bond-slave of the Demon Emperor. Here, without permission? Strange but not unusual. No cause for alarm but certainly a source of rumor.

Five days, it took to cross the Endless Desert. Five days: no more, no less. So was the Desert constrained by the oaths upon her own name. The Wind's daughters might yet escape as their sisters had, at first glimpse of madness. Their father might flee his master for a time. Yet the little things would report this insurrection, and all would be right. Nothing unusual.

By the third day, the least of demons began to watch from afar. None dared approach the Wind whose Silence was death. By the fourth day, some of their lords watched with dull amusement. As the hours crept on, even some of the princes and masters turned their gaze to what would hopefully be a farce or tragedy. A mother must say farewell to her children after such short reunion. Boo hoo.

Then the Wind would forget again. Certainly, the loss of the lesser Winds would change things. Yet, Hell had seen their birth without fanfare. It would not mourn their escape.

As the final hour closed, the world came into view. The daughters and their father would slip away unopposed after all. It seemed the Grand Prince of Hell had learned his lesson after failing to recapture the last three runaways. He was out of practice, and his hunting hound was dull from guarding rotten treasure. The proudest prince would not embarrass himself again.

On the horizon was a handsome woman with short silver hair that rolled like the dunes. The Desert, manifest. Strange. She had always hated to be less than Endless. Hated to look like the wretched apes which had bound her. Perhaps she did so for cruel irony. Perhaps she would turn back the refugees while wearing such pathetic shape, that she might shame them with her might.

The Endless Desert smiled her too-wide smile. Cruelty always followed. As lips of flesh parted, so too did a vast valley part the dunes. Only, it was behind the fugitives.

The Wind clapsed the Desert's hand. The pair suddenly seemed terribly distant from the onlookers.

Beneath the feet of all demons, the whole of the Demon Realm shuddered. The Emperor's baleful gaze fell upon the Wind and the Desert. The Desert's own eyes twitched in satisfaction, but she said nothing. She stood and looked up into Hell's mad green sun. The Wind took one step past the Desert.

The onlookers realized what that meant.

It was impossible. The masters of the damned could not leave.

The masters of the damned could not leave.

Even the wretched spirit of liberation could not shed the vows sworn on her name-of-names. Rarely, one of the damned spirits would be slain and born anew. A new name, a new manifestation. Yet their eternal hearts-of-hearts would remain.

The masters of the damned could never escape the oaths they had made. Then why?

"WHAT BETRAYAL IS THIS?" the whole realm roared with the voice of the Emperor.

The Silent Wind smiled. It was in her nature to race toward the greatest noise and smother it. Now, she did not even start.

"Oh," she giggled. "Of everything. I don't need it."

When she spoke, it was not proper language. The elegant, flowing, and gutteral sounds were gone. This was some bastard trade tongue of the mortals, clipped and awkward.

Beneath the sun, a green and rotting shooting star descended. The Emperor made manifest. His voice yet still resounded from all directions.

"EXPLAIN YOURSEL-"

"No. Bye bye."

The Wind set her other foot past the Desert's body and vanished. Her daughters and then consort likewise slipped Hell's grasp.

A silent eternity passed. The onlookers stared at the Desert. Hell's warden had never needed compelling to enforce the demands of their conquerors. She did so for spite and pride. Her bonds were among the greatest, and she would not suffer her lessers more freedom than she.

The Wind and the Desert did not hate one another, but they were fundamentally incompatible. Yet, the Desert had done nothing.

The screaming metal star struck ground. The dunes exploded, and a conflagration engulfed most of the onlookers. Even the princes did not escape unscathed, buried for several minutes beneath balefire and molten glass.

As the smoke cleared, the figure of the Emperor arose, a thing of fire and metal and fury.

"SPEAK."

"Acknowledged."

Always the letter of the law with the Desert. And amending the law when that didn't work.

"EXPLAIN!"

"Clarify the question."

"I AM THE WORLD ON WHICH YOU STAND. I AM THE POISONED AIR AND THE LIGHT WHICH BLINDS. IT IS BY MY GRACE THAT ALL SUCH PARASITES AS LIVE HERE DO NOT PERISH."

"Statement acknowledged. I repeat: clarify the question."

"DO YOU THINK YOURSELF ABOVE ME?"

"My duty is separate from my relationship to any inmates."

"IN...MATES...!"

They were not inmates, of course. They were not imprisoned. They were merely in exile to regroup and rethink their strategy.

"Yes, and if I may be so bold to infer your line of questioning, you are asking for information regarding one who has been rehabilitated from my care. I am not at liberty to discuss such details with my charges."

The Emperor's next word was brimstone.

"I will clarify for the record. The only law is rule of the strong. Which one of you is still shackled?"
