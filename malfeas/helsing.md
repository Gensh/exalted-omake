"Here," the prince said solemnly. "I… no matter how I fight it, my hands don't move like they used to. And this is more than I would have dreamed to build then."

He hesitated and looked longingly at the firewand in his hand. His lips twitched, and he shook his head before handing it to her. The body was a single piece of faintly green celadon. Elaborate signs of praise and protection were lovingly sealed into the surface. There was a tasteful filigree of orichalc which hung lightly over the whole piece like a coronet.

"I tried to make it like I did so long ago, but it… turned out wrong again. Like always. It is as fragile as it looks." He smiled faintly. "But so are you. And look at the power you both command."

She found that it had been so carefully sculpted and fired that the ceramic grip fit her hand perfectly.

"This is quite heavy," she said.

She hefted the flamepiece for emphasis. It was impossibly light. The smith frowned.

"Do not patronize me. I recognize what this seems. There is enough of me left which is not bitter. I can still admit when I admire another. You are nothing and have nothing, and still– still–! bested all of us.

I have never been truly kind to you. Yet it would do me honor if you would allow me to continue calling you 'cousin'. Without my former resentment or mockery."

She pulled the trigger. The hammer cracked Time itself, and infinite power roared from the window into history. A beam of twenty-two-and-one colors which do not exist pealed from the barrel. Shades which you can only see when you press your eyes too hard tore through the muted colors of the ghost's corpus like light striking a prism.
