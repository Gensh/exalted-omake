When Ignis came to me...

He was confident. Certain. As was his due.

He had never failed, though some among us had tried to break him. This was no grand adventure, no daring rescue or foul beast to slay. It was diplomacy of the simplest kind.

He had a masterfully-crafted proposal he wished his fair and just aunt to sign off on. That was all.

"Why must the least things suffer? As Creation is endless in size and age, each could have its place and make obeisance to Heaven. There is no need to take their lives in sacrifice.

Why must the servants grind always at their duties? Tirelessness is not faultlessness. If allowed leisure, they will have time for maintenance and might return with greater efficiency."

In that time, Ignis was Unconquered in all things, so I knew his words to be true.

Yet to commit to such policies was not something I would consider.

"Who are you to deny your betters the pleasures of screams? Who are you to question the works blessed by the Most High?"

I thought first that bringing such a myopic proposal before Him would displease Him. That fear alone might have been enough to sway me. Yet in that time, I was fair and just, so I bestowed the Unconquered Sun the fullness of my attention.

I knew what kindness and mercy would cost.

I would turn my endless eyes from Him Alone and look to the lesser things for an intolerable time.

I would necessarily go among the low things and uncleanliness.

I mean not the sweat-stained gods of the Blessed Isle, nor the blood-spattered mortals beyond. In this time, they were pure and holy in purpose.

No, it was among our lesser kin that I would be forced to walk.

To take Isidoros by the tusks as he wallowed in muck and grime, and cast him away from that which he would crush underfoot.

To stand before Wyld-stained Adrian and bear her blades as living shield for some precious thing too near Creation's edge.

To listen to wretched Autochthon's repeated pleas to save his chosen mortals, who settled only in places which stank of our disdain.

It would be the work of forty-thousand years to lay my laws upon them.

For mercy's sake.

For kindness' sake.

Frankly, it took all my dignity to refrain from calling Ignis--

Well.

I settled for watching the light in his eyes die.

I dismissed him.

And set the destiny of Creation.

All the evils of the world came to pass not for the Primordials' pride.

But for my sloth.
