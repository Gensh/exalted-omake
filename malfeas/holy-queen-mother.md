# The Holy Queen-Mother

There are certain cosmological constants across shards. These may remain largely unchanged, such as the death of Mardukth, or they may diverge broadly within their themes. One of these latter is Lillun, the vessel of the Infernal Exaltations.

Most often the daughter of the Scarlet Empress but sometimes a demon, sentient architecture, or even stranger things – Lillun is bound mostly by her name and role. Yet by the phenomenal cross-narrative efforts of heroes and the Lilluns themselves, that role of vessel is becoming extinct. One day, there will be no more Lilluns forced to suffer anew.

We may later speak of the Confluence of Lillun, the grand council of the Lilluns' fevered minds, where they seek commiseration with their own kind across the shards. We may later speak of its many luminaries: from its founder Lillun-a-Glimmering, First Chosen of the Dragon Beyond the World; to Lillun Ebonhand, who carved her captor into a vessel of her wrath. For now, we will speak only of the eldest.

Few can say which Lillun began their multiversal suffering, but there is one who stands head and shoulders above the others – quite literally. This is the Holy Queen-Mother, Lillun the First and Last. Precious few Lilluns have the gift she has been given: she has remained lucid since she first assumed her role and has even grown to adulthood.
