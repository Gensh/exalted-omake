Heavy clouds stretched over the barren plain, dying it blue as it was hidden from the light of the Unconquered Sun. The clouds twisted until they tore open in the center, and the emerald light of hell's green sun poured onto a descending figure. It wore plate armor in the style of early First Age cataphracts in white jade and orichalc. A cape whipped in the storm wind, and circuits of essence burned across the armor's surface.

The helmed figure clapped, and thunder clapped with it. A heavy rain poured, made all the heavier for each drop carrying a grain of silver sand. Within moments, the plain had turned to a desert which shone like a broken mirror.

The figure threw its hands wide, and essence circuits all along the armor's gauntlets flickered. Those patterns reflected on the sand below, and the dunes shuddered. The cataphract raised its hands, and a shape began to rise, the falling rain giving it definition as it emerged. It was a great cog, and it rose to join another already turning.

Each cog moved with its own storm, winding about a pillar of poisoned light between the two. Already, seven such cogs churned through Creation's soil, leaving behind grains of the Endless Desert. Each bore towers the likes of which had not been seen for an Age – academies, factories, hydroponic farms, and anything else requried to sustain the system.

This was Tzent, the City of Wheels and duchy of Cecelyne. Through the splendor of this city-state, Our Lady of Hypocrisy would garner new faithful and teach the mortals of Creation to resent the gods which gave them nothing. In their desolate hearts, she would live most of all.

Yet the machinations of his mistress were, as ever, far from Gabrien Murmur's thoughts. He descended to the center of the new cog and removed his masked helm. He was the sort who never seemed to age… or to grow up. He had boyish (if gaunt) looks, with sharp golden eyes and oily, wiry black hair. Clearly not Creation-born, as if his natural use of Autochthonian essence technology didn't make his origins obvious.

He raised two fingers, and a pair of overly-elegant chairs arose from the living metal of the cog. He sat in one and leaned back, crossing one leg into his lap.

"So, as you've seen before, this is the first type of shaping." He waved idly at the surroundings, before adding, "This is shaping as the Exalted typically know it. When you finally get to the brass tacks and have to fight some rogue Solar or another, this is what might get thrown at you."

"Right."

Trishula Murmur joined her father and unconsciously copied him before awkwardly setting her leg back on the ground. She'd inherited his unruly hair and the harsher part of his facial features but otherwise quite resembled her mother. She was already taller than he was, even excluding the geta which added more than a head of height.

"But," she said, wagging a finger, "I already know all about the next type of shaping. Shaping narratives. Weaving Fate and all that jazz. What's the gimmick here? You going to teach me how to hack the Weave of Autochthon using Yozi magic?"

"Well, not today. Probably not anytime soon. Not that I can do it, I mean."

"Riiiight."

Trish pulled some still-hot tea from Elsewhere and took a sip to punctuate her disbelief.

"Regardless" Duke Murmur said, "I intended on running a demonstration of the second type of shaping, full Yozi style. The problem is, it's basically brainwashing. And I'm not about to revisit the whole 'poison your lunch to innoculate you against poison' debacle."

Trishula choked on her tea.

"Poison my what?"

"It's fine. It only happened once. Your mother had to set some ground rules with the Bureau." He paused. "You can read between the lines."

"You're kiddi– Oh. Yikes. I'm not sure what's more horrifying, then."

"Oh, it's worse than that. Gramma got involved."

Trish jumped up, spun her chair around backward and leaned into it.

"Yes! Storytime. Now. I absolutely have to hear about Gramma's rampage."

The Duke crossed his arms.

"No, no. We've blocked off this time for shaping lessons. You can ask her yourself when you're skilled enough to take lessons from her."

"Wait, I get to learn shaping from Gramma? Dad, that's busted. That's just egregiously not fair. Sids don't even get cool enough shaping effects for that."

"Do you really think the Hierophant of the Yozis has no weight in Heaven? What do you take your father for? Isn't there a certain way for the Sidereal Exalted to mimic a Primordial shintai?"

"You did _not_ get me a Border of Kaleidoscopic Logic sifu. You di- who? What level of blackmail did this involve? I can't even learn it yet!"

"Bold of you to think I can't enlighten your essence."

"But starting to learn a style without being able to reach-"

"Twice. Or more. Your mother and I have discussed it with Gramma and with Ligier. To tie this into our lecture – shaping is still a fairly high-level language of paracausal manipulation. All you really need is the confidence to get started. Things like refining essence beyond natural limits requires exploiting existing structures… or changing them. It seems the old Creation-born Exalted lacked the knack for purer logics. Manipulating the shinma isn't _that_ difficult."

"Well, to circle back, I'm not going to demo Yozi-style shaping combat by forcing you to see every shade of blue as azure. I could use it on the environment, sure, but that's either more of the same or it's comparatively boring. I could shape a pond so that the dominant breed of fish is different in three generations. No one cares."
