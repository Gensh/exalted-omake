"Tell me more about the Divine Revolution. How did it happen? What were the first signs that the system was… breaking down? And what was it like for you, the HR manager of the universe, to watch it all fall apart?"

There were no signs, so to speak. There were known elements of discontent, and they were each managed.

Firstly, under my brother's Pax Empyrea, there would be no more war among the Primes. They were to negotiate grievances among themselves or to bring them before myself. The latter was a matter of last resort, for to come before the Lawmaker Princess was to be bound and to create a binding precedent. To submit to the Law was to forgo any potential to cheat or regain your losses later.

The second matter. The Great Maker Autochthon, runt of the Primes and so Titan of Tools and Improvement, hated his lot. He was abused, and we who knew only strength, who did not know reliance on prosthetics or the affection for the work of one's hands, stole or mocked his creations. This too was made a non-issue by the Pax, but I also ensured he was always distracted by some new bauble so he would not complain so loudly.

Next, the gods. They are not supreme like a god of monotheism, nor were they flawed like the gods of dramas. They were celestial bureaucrats and wonderworkers, bound to an order greater than themselves. They were a slave race who we did not believe were slaves, for they were so much lesser than we. They could not have harmed us if they had tried, yet to avoid accidents, we had bound them with a Great Geas of my design, that they may never have the hope of trying. For hope, like all things made by Autochthon, had a tendency to explode.

So we come to the final known. Above the gods, the truly great among the Primes created the Celestial Incarnae, beings of true magnificence. It was only for the Incarnae that the rest of us could conceive of the affection Autochthon held for his creations. It is said that we treated them as our children, but that is not quite correct. We treated them as… hypotheticals. As our favorite characters, who we genuinely cared for but whose lives we would uproot and whose histories we would reshape as held our interest.

Their leader and lover, the Unconquered Sun, sat at the right hand of my brother the Universe Emperor. He beheld all and rankled. Why should the Primes be allowed to despoil the work of his brother-gods? Why should they alone be allowed leisure. Why should the small things, the mortals and the beasts, suffer when all the world was so perfectly ordered?

The King of the Gods, favored of the King of All Kings, took the gamble and came before the Lawmaker Princess with a proposal to make all things truly perfect and at peace. And I denied him, for that was a work of forty thousand years. Why should I, second of the Primes, be forced to walk among all the lowly and lay my Law upon them? I turned him away, and set a hardness in his heart.

But he could do nothing. Even he, perfect and undiminished, could not bend the Geas I had laid upon all gods.

I may have lost track of time and failed to provide our genius with something to occupy his mind. Autochthon, head always down, discovered one of their "secret" meetings I had chosen to ignore. He asked what they were willing to give of themselves for freedom, for in my sloth, I had neglected one thing.

The least of all mortals. The humans. The great ones, I had bound in some fashion, for Kimbery would command the Lintha to undermine any other Prime's projects upon the earth if I did not.

The Sun, for all his later failings, chose with his heart, without hesitation. With the addition of the youngest Prime — Gaia, the Titan of Cycles and Seasons (who was mostly there as a booty call) — they crafted _Exaltation_, the process by which mere could be imbued with the might of the Primes' most complex creations.
