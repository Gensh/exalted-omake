The sky cracked. The fabric of Creation groaned under the strain. The Way Shinma gave a tired sigh as an old wound opened to bleed once more. The terrestrial world was bridged directly to the Demon City like splicing together the veins of estranged kin. The ghastly blue fire of celestial Law perverted burned a hole in the world, and ten-thousand bright red needles of rust pierced the wound. Leering demon faces carved into the crumbling metal cackled as they heard distant Heaven fall into panic.

The Scarlet Bridge, that abominable work of artifice which had lain dormant until recent years, manifested yet again. The far end in hell had been hidden, but more and more frequently, the near side breached the material world – unbound by the Oaths of the Demon Princes which held the monsters of the demon realm captive. Now its arch hung perilously in the sky, and its length burrowed through space itself, displacing the walls of a tower considered impenetrable.

Two figures emerged from the azure portal at the Bridge's apex and proceeded into the tower unopposed.

Centered and implacable strode forth the High Holy Queen, Lillun Dragondaughter, Mother and Sister of the Infernal Exalted. Her hair was blood and ink, and her eyes were the emerald light of an alien sun. Her robe was fool's gold and midnight pacts. From her pale, unmarred flesh was strewn chains of cold iron oaths. Twenty-two-and-one brass shrines which were also horns orbited her indelible gravity, sounding the will of the Yozis.

At her side was her faithful hound, as ever. The Familiar Famine hung on their master's shoulder and devoured the pair's very presence. Sight, sound, and memory of hell's most precious jewel could not be entrusted to the common run of mankind. Mina-Khagan alone of the Infernal Exalted was allowed to slay their siblings without consulting the Yozis, for such was the need of the Holy Queen-Mother's protection.

The roiling pot of flesh could not be distinguished as Solar or Lunar and willed itself into human shape only for the convenience of their charge. Sometimes an evening gown of viscera. Sometimes lamellar of bone. Always an auburn-haired young woman of age to match Lillun's own.

Thirteen accursed years, the hopelessly human High Holy Queen had "reigned" over the mad Chosen of Hell, preserved only by the enduring magics of the Demon Princes which nailed the leashes of their Exalted pawns through her flesh and soul. Their wild emotions, encouraged to excess by the demon realm, ran through her. The death of any of her "children" caused her such grief and physical pain as to break any lesser. But Lillun Dragondaughter had been forged for this role.

Yet a tool in use may find a purpose for which it is better suited than the smith intended. Mother and Sister, she was uniquely empowered to seize the hearts of Hell's Chosen. She knew all their desires, even those they could not admit to themselves. As they began to age; as those first mad Chosen perished and were replaced; as more stable Infernals outlasted their peers, they had more and more things which they held precious. In unwitting imitation of the Yozis, they wrapped themselves in chains. And Lillun was no stranger to imprisonment.

One such chain she followed now as it tugged like a fish on her line.

Crimson lightning cracked as the High Holy Queen of Hell, Lillun Dragondaughter entered the room in all her wretched splendor. The toxic fog of the Demon City rolled along the floor, withering whatever natural materials had been carelessly left out.

"You called?" she asked, her voice sweet like black liccorice.

"Liiiiiil, you melted my drawings again. I wanted to show you that one."

Indeed, there was a crude drawing on the floor near the end of the bridge. It featured hell's beloved luminary Ligier stabbing figures conspicuously labeled "the bad guys." Lillun casually recognized several major celestial gods and censors. The fine paper had just now spontaneously burst into green flame.

"Oh no, I'm so sorry! I– I'll at least make sure Makarios ships your favorite colored markers next time. Maybe you can make a better one? I think Ligier would really like it if you drew him with ink that glows in the dark."

"Okay. But if you melt that one too, I'm telling 'yesha, and she'll add it to the list of all the bad things she tells people about you. It's a real long list."

It had begun with Mina but it certainly would not end with the child glowering at her from within a pillow fortress – the Infernal Exalted had begun to reproduce. Most of the children were hellspawn in both senses of the word. Lillun sometimes had to pick up the pieces of broken psyches as lovers died in the brutal birthing process of Infernal whelps.

But then there was Trishula Murmur, who had come out Chosen by Fate. Now five years old, she was beginning to recognize the propaganda games her father played with her Sidereal tutor.

"Oh, I'm sure Acting Director Ura will love to hear– well, let's not get into that now. It's late, you know. I'm sure you have a very busy day tomorrow, learning the history of paperwork or how to punch people in the destiny so hard that they turn into ducks."

That time it worked. Trish giggled.

"That's not what Duck Fate means!"

"Yes, well, there _is_ a special punch that can do that."

"Is it like the time when we ran out of meat, so Mina's dad turned a blood ape into twelve chickens?"

"No, no, no," Lillun said, wagging her finger. "You're not trained enough to distract me yet. You know what it means for me to use the Bridge. You get one thing, and then I have to leave. Now, what was it that you needed?"

"Liiiil, I can't sleep. Mom and Dad and Nemnem were all busy tonight. Tell me a story."

This was probably the most frivolous use of a world-shattering artifact Lillun had experienced, and she'd seen the sorts of exceptionally stupid things Infernals did in their free time.

"Yeah, tell us a story, Lil!"

Sometimes the High Holy Queen's faithful hound was more like a lapdog. Mina took several steps and turned around to stare at Lillun with anticipation. She extruded a chair from her own flesh and bone and bounced in it excitedly. Lillun waited a moment for dramatic effect, but Trish spoke again.

"Wait, Mina, I learned this in class. We have to offer her something in return."

"Ooh, are they teaching you demon binding?"

"No, it's just _greasing the wheels_."

Enslaved by the Demon Princes or not, Lillun was definitely going to enjoy burning down Heaven. Trish continued.

"Uhhh, I think I've got some gum. Mina, what's in your pockets?"

Mina looked sheepish.

"Lil doesn't let Mina answer those sorts of questions anymore."

The other girl continued instead: "Wait, I can _cheat_. Lil, what's your favorite thing in the world?"

"Well, I–"

"Don't pretend it's not coffee, Liiiil. I know where Mom keeps the good stuff, and I know Ligier doesn't let you have any anymore."

That wasn't totally true, but–

"Deal."

Mina snorted.

"Trish, you really _were_ born to be a politician, weren't you? You are a terrible person."

"Thanks, I guess. Story now. Storytime. Coffee later."

"Very well. I know you won't be awake to tell me, so I'll have Mina search your mind, with your consent."

"Suresure. Story."

"What do you-?"

"I wanna hear the one about the Priest and the Princess again."

Lillun faintly smiled at herself. She'd be bested by a child again.

"Oh, that is a long one. Your training is too thorough. Very well. A deal is a deal. I am a woman of my word. Do keep in mind that few people will be as earnest in their contracts."

"I didn't summon 'yesha for a lecture, Liiiiiil. Storytime."

Lillun reached for a chair of silver demon-wood which wouldn't rot in the fog still spilling down the steps of the Bridge. She pulled it aside the bed and cleared her throat.

Once upon a time, there was a princess who did not know she was a princess. She lived in a small village with father, who chopped wood. She had never met her mother, but her mother _did_ leave her a letter. That letter said many things she didn't understand. The most important part, though – the part her father read to her every day – said to never trust the shadows.

One day, when the princess was playing hide-and-go-seek with the other children, she ran deep into the woods. She could hide there very well because she had learned a lot from her father. This time, as she tried to hide so well that she could never be found, the woods seemed to get darker and darker. She tried to go back, but the woods didn't look like they used to.

Eventually, it was so dark that she coudn't see anything. Then another girl snuck up on her. The princess couldn't see anything, but she could see the girl. The girl was made out of shadows which were darker than the darkness.

The shadow-girl said, "Hello, my name is Erembour, and I've been looking for you. Your father is worried sick that he hasn't been able to find you."

The princess was surprised because she didn't think she had been gone that long yet. But she was scared enough to believe the shadow-girl. The princess knew her mother had said not to trust the shadows, but Erembour promised that she would take the princess back to her father. So the princess followed Erembour, even as the trees all disappeared, and they started walking on sand. The princess had never felt sand before, so she didn't know she had crossed into the desert.

She saw light in the distance and thought they were at the end of the forest. But the light was green instead of yellow, and when they reached the end of the desert, it was a city and not the village. The princess wanted to call Erembour a liar, but then the shadow-girl cried out "Father!"

The princess thought it might be her own father, but it was the father of all shadows. The princess was his daughter now too, because her mother had traded her for magic. The father of all shadows had been looking for her for many years but had only just now found her.

The princess said that she wanted to go home to her father who chopped wood. Her new father who was shadow told her that if she was a very good girl and worked very hard, then she would be able to go home any time she wanted. But first, she had to learn how to be a shadow.

The father of all shadows called all of his shadow children to greet their new sister. They taught her all the ways of being a shadow. Some of them were fun. The princess still enjoyed being very good at hiding. But sometimes being a shadow is just being a very bad person. A lot of times, that meant the other shadows were mean and nasty, and the princess swore that she would _strangle the life out of Deer-Footed Mara_, but the princess learned to be a very good shadow. She could copy anyone doing anything, just as fast as they could think.

The princess asked her shadow-father if she could go home yet. He said no. He said that everyone had to go home together. All her new family and all the other people living in the city wanted to go home too. They lived in a place that was very near her village, and there were some mean people who wouldn't let them go home. If the princess wanted to see her father who cut wood, she had to help her shadow family fight the mean people.

Shadows aren't very good at fighting, so her father who was shadows had found help instead. He brought forty-nine heroes to help the other people in the city. It was going to be the princess' job to keep the heroes from forgetting they all wanted to go home. Heroes are very strong, but they sometimes forget what they're doing or get confused about who their friends are.

The princess was a very good shadow. She was very good at reminding the heroes about things because she could copy what they used to look like.

The first heroes were very bad at fighting and remembering they were supposed to be fighting. Sometimes they got hurt and came back with different faces. One of the ones that came back was a priest with fluffy hair. It was hard for the princess to understand the priest. The priest loved light, and it was hard for the princess to understand light because she was so good at being a shadow.

Some of the heroes wanted to be friends with the princess. Some of the heroes thought the princess would let them slack off if they were nice to her. These heroes all asked if the princess could go home to her father who chopped wood, even if just for a day. Each time her father who was shadows and the mayor of the city said "No, we all have to go home together."

Most heroes nodded and said they understood, even if they didn't. The priest who loved light didn't understand. One day, the priest asked an eagle and a wolf if they could help the princess find her way back home. The eagle could see the way, and the wolf could follow the scent of the princess' father who chopped wood. The eagle asked her father – who was a great big pig – if he could help. One day, the great big pig ran through the city and made a big distraction. That was the signal that they would help the princess escape the city.

The priest, the wolf, and the eagle ran to the princess and told her that she could go home. They would help her, but this would be the only chance for any of them to leave the city.

The princess told them no. The princess was very good at being a shadow, you see. She had learned what light looked like and how to see the way home and how to follow the scent of her father who chopped wood. She could go home any time she liked now.

First, she had to help the heroes remember what they were doing and who their friends were. She had to help them remember what she had just learned – what light looked like. The priest and the eagle and the wolf all agreed that was a very brave thing to do and promised to keep helping the princess.

The mayor _did_ catch the great big pig, but what was the mayor going to do to a great big pig? The great big pig wandered off to splash in a mud puddle and make an even bigger mess.

The princess kept guiding the heroes like she was supposed to, but she wasn't alone now. The priest could drive away the shadows with light. The eagle could find high places where the shadows couldn't reach. The wolf could hide among the shadows and trick them. With friends to help, the princess was even able to sneak home sometimes.

Sometimes to tell bedtime stories.

"Yay!" Mina whispered. "Now tell one about Mina-self."

Lillun sighed.

"Mina, Trish has been asleep since the part with Erembour."

"...what if Mina hunted a whole coffee shipment?"

"No."

"What if Mina bioengineered a-"

"We are done here, Mina. Please collect my prize."

Lillun pointed to Duke Murmur, who had an aromatic paper bag in one hand. It was rare to see the Hierophant of the Yozis out of heavy armor, but it was also rare to barge into an Infernal's home in the middle of the night. He only wore a simple evening robe, but lightning arced beneath his skin to make up for the lack of decoration.

"You… parked the giant glowing bridge in the middle of my tower. I know most people can't see it, but I try to keep rumors of strange phenomena to a minimum."

"That's not why you're here, old man."

Gabrien Murmur threw the bag of coffee beans to Mina, who rose at last.

"It's strange that you're still telling the story like that. I don't remember being so heroic. And I'm fairly certain Higarda did more than I did."

"Higarda can get a bigger role the next time she actually does something selfless instead of her weird favor-trading game with Mother."

Lillun swept the air to show she was brushing aside the matter.

"Mina. Back hellside," she snapped before turning back to Murmur. "Do not doubt yourself. That's not the way of the Hell's Chosen and certainly not of the Yozis' mouthpiece. And you're still dancing around the topic."

"Not to be ungrateful, but isn't using the Bridge always a risk? It's not like the time with Number Fifty."

"It is, though. It's about what all of this means. It's about empathizing with mad titans but still holding them to their crimes. It's about identifying _what light is_. A lot of people are going to try to use Trish sooner or later. I will ensure, come Malfeas or Kimbery, that she does not become what I am. I want to make sure she knows that no matter what, someone _will_ come when she calls."
